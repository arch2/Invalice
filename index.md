_Current Mission_

> Ohm and Jamison were given a mission to tell the Wizards College of A famous wizards death. The queen wants us to make contact with the wizards college because the kingdom has lost touch with the college. They’ve sent 2 parties to the college already and have lost all contact with both parties. There is a magical barrier around the college.

## Session 3

> 11/9/21 _And so it begins_

We wake up at Rocky 4 after heavily drinking and everyone feels refreshed and nobody is hungover. Ohm is eating his breakfast sausages as Nessa adds it to his tab. The bar was packed last night but the profit numbers weren’t that great due to overpours and comps. Furtim grabs some scrambled eggs and puts them in his pocket for later. Mogali gathers what seems like trash to start his day. Bronson tells the kobalts that Mermista has already had her fill of breakfast sausage and she punches him in the ribs.

Mermista asks Furtim about his intentions, he was working undercover, and he thought our quest was a good way to move to his next location. He is very forgettable when he changes, and so nobody will notice him when he leaves the queen’s guard. Furtim pulls out his Zulkcoon and plays it beautifully and the entire bar stop what they’re doing to listen to his performance. The bar goes nuts. Jamison tries to hire Furtim and hands him his card and Furtim just stuffs it into his egg pocket and everyone notices except Jamison. Mogali notices an older woman with red and silver hair and a little boy, the brother of the one that Mogali saved. The boy runs over to Mogali, he doesn’t recognize him, he has a parcel to thank him for saving his brother. Mog opens the parcel with his mittens and sees a curved stone, milky white opal. Mog is happy he is wearing a mask so the kid can’t see his extremely disappointed face. The mother assures him it is a family heirloom that will bring him luck. Mog puts the rock in one of his many pockets. The boy says he wants to grow up to be just like Mogali and he gives the kid a tin can that he says used to hold a big spirit, the kid lights up and completely believes him and thanks him.

Jamison wants to finalize all of the duties for Rocky 4 before he leaves to make life easier for Nessa. Nessa doesn’t believe J for a second that he will only be gone for a few days. Ohm tries to steal some silverware, the Kobalt recognize but they don’t snitch but they know Ohm has been doing this frequently. J is leaving the bar in Nessa’s control again and she is getting worried and frustrated that J always does this. J promises Nessa a nice souvenir when he gets back.

We all leave the bar and go on our quest, we go to the town square, it’s a saturday and everyone for the most part has off. Sigurd and Imit approach us followed by the 6 of the queen’s guard. Sigurd goes up to J and asks if our party is ready, Sigurd wants to make sure we will be professional about this after chanting Queen’s Quest last night. Nessa leaves the bar and screams at Ohm about her silverware, he runs away with his pockets jangling. Sigurd and J argue and S is pissed that the party undercut his authority. J apologizes. The queen’s guard drops off 1 cart 2 donkeys, a satchel filled with various tools, as well as 200 gold pieces. J investigates the satchel and Sig tells her that the queen didn’t want to give us any gold but Sig snuck it to us. Ohm tries to jump into a hay cart but he crashes into it and silverware is just pouring out onto the streets. Nessa is cursing him out and Ohm rolls for persuasion, he crit fails and now Ohm just lost his comp tab. WORST THAN DEATH (TANYA TREATMENT)

Old Maggie comes up to us and asks where we’re going. Mog counters, “SHOULDN’T YOU KNOW THAT?”. She looks at Furtim and we all notice this glare she gives him, we can’t surmise anything else. She asks if we’re heading out of the Rothelm, Ohm is super depressed because he lost his golden ticket. Mermista asks Maggie about the look she gave Furtim, “a knowledge of fate intertwined”. We do a perception check, Bronson regrets not getting his fortune checked, Ohm CRITS and Mermista realizes that she is spying on us and is seeking information. Mermista and Ohm refuse to disclose any more information. Mermista wants to know why she answers our questions in riddles and why she wants to know where we’re going. Maggie says our fates are intertwined and she can’t explain how but she knows she’s a part of our future.

We have two cart spots and two donkey spots, Ohm and Mermista are in the cart, Bronson is riding one of the donkeys named Choncho charcoal one. Mogali is riding his trash pile, Furtim and Jamison are walking. Ohm carves Grox into the cart. We are leaving the city into the Longwood and our DM can’t keep a straight face. Maggie is still with us at the time, she has a carriage that is not being drawn by anything, she bids us a safe journey and says we will meet again. Bronson tells Choncho not to trust her, he rolls a NAT 20 and tells Choncho to remember her scent and Choncho snuffs in acknowledgement. Old maggie goes back home.

We decide to travel North, the shorter route, and as we head to the north we pass different groups of people but they are less and less the farther north we get. We come across what looks like a chain gang with 2 queen’s guards in armor and 4 men digging a ditch in jumpsuits. Ohm tosses a hardboiled egg at the prisoner that looks most like a luke, the egg just falls in the dirt and everyone is confused. One of the guards yells no feeding the prisoners. Fultim grabs the egg and pockets it. Mermista asks the guards why they’re digging the ditch, he says they are terrorists and spies of the ILC. Bronson asks the prisoners where they come from, one of the prisoners responds that most of them come from the west. Mog asks if anyone has come from the north, a guard asks why we’re heading north?. Mermista tries to scream QUEENS QUEST but Jamison covers her mouth. Mog asks whats up north, and Furtim asks if they want any eggs, Bronson just screams if they want any eggs, they are weirded out. Bronson apologizes and Furtim hands Bronson Jamison’s egg covered business card and he tells them that they have free drinks at Rocky 4 for life. Ohm yells for them to tell Nessa that it’s on Ohm’s tab.

We continue north and take a rest. Bronson and Budgie take first watch, as the party sleeps, Budgie and Bronson start vibing to their nonsense tunes. We hear the high grass brussling around us, Budgie perks up and is on full alert. Bronson knows that Budgie is freaking out because somebody is nearby, he senses trouble is near, he screams for everyone to wake up. Jamison and Ohm realize that one of the Goblins is the one they let escape and now there are five goblins, a goblin captain, and a direwolf. We roll for Initiative.

RUFIO LEARNS TO MAKE A MAP ON ROLL 20… WE WAIT

COMBAT BEGINS!!!!!!!

Mermista uncaps her waterskin and forms her waterstaff, and attacks G5, she crushes his skull and instakills his head as it goes flying and she taps her chest and yells Vamos Puneta. Mogali moves with Budgie to the Goblin Boss and crushes him with his Halbert for 14 damage. The goblin boss looks pretty fucked up, Lil Budgie attacks and a 15 does not hit. Goblin Boss attacks Mog, Budgie gives GB disadvantage as he freaks out and GB misses. Jamison snipes the fuck out of a goblin through its earhole. Furtim

THERE’S A BOUNTY FOR THE GROUPS HEADS!!!!!!!!! As Jamison is about to kill the snitch goblin

## Session 4

> 11/16/21 _Between Some Rocks and a Hard Place_

Jamison is holding the snitch Goblin by the throat and she finds a bag of gold in one hand and a bounty for our party. The scroll has a price of 100 gold coins for info or dispatchment of our party, signed by the Red Order. J screams demanding to know who the Red Order is, with Ohm’s help, J intimidates the fuck out of him and he says he doesn’t know anything else but they wanted us taken out ASAP. The goblin is trying to escape, Bro pulls out his crossbow and points it at his head, the arrow just barely misses and he starts screaming. Ohm tries to knock him out but whiffs. Mogali ties up and gags the goblin and hitches him up to the back of the wagon. Mermista intimidates the ever loving fuck out of the goblin with a dirty 20 so that we can get a long rest without him making any noise. This goblin is so fucking traumatized.

Ohm starts cooking eggs and sausage in the morning, he does a perception check and rolls super high and notices his shield pulsing very briefly, he does an insight check and realizes it has something to do with his lord Grox. Jamison takes the gold from the goblin. Jamison doesn’t trust the fact that Furtim is on the bounty, and he demands to know more about him. Furtim plays his Zulckoon and regails us with his life’s story. He reveals that he is a changeling as he changes into Mogali. The party begins to trust Furtim and realize how much of an asset he can be. Bronson points out we can use him for kinky stuff, and then the group agrees that he is useful.

We head north and see the same two guards we saw the other day but only 3 prisoners instead of 4 this time. Jamison asks about the 4th prisoner and the guard shrugs it off. We head to the checkpoint to get to the east of the Spine so that we can head towards the Wizards College. We approach the checkpoint and we see 2 soldiers outside the entrance, they are casually talking, behind them is a large watchtower and living quarters. We tie the goblin underneath the wagon. Furtim rolls to tie up the goblin but he does a very mediocre job. Bronson hops off of Choncho and tries to warm up to the guards, they do not buy what he’s putting down. He hands them the queen’s writ that is for some reason hidden in one of Bronson’s sea bottles. They shake off the alcohol on the writ as it is all soggy. Ohm tells them we are on a Queen’s Quest and runs off laughing. Jamison starts crying for no reason. Mogali just walks up and fails so hard on his persuasion. We are so fucking awkward.

Furtim approaches while still in Mogali form and the guards just assume that they’re just dressed in the same uniform. He offers them some eggs and the guards say they need to check our cart. Mermista approaches the guards and tells them about the Queen’s quest and tells them about the goblin tied up underneath our cart. She rolls so shitty and the guards are so confused. Mermista just straight up tells them that he tried to kill us, the guards free him and tell us that they will keep him prisoner. Mermista insists that we need him, she rolls a NAT 20 and convinces them to let us keep him as this goblin is sobbing, we refuse to learn his name because he is goblin trash.

WE CONTINUE OUR QUEST

We enter into Checkpass Titan and it is not very populated, but we realize that everyone has their purpose here. As we look east we see a defensive structure blocking people from the east from entering Wroughthelm. Mogali asks a elf that’s having a smoke break about the defense structure. The elf says that there are attacks coming from the mountain from time to time. We just pass through and take a smoke break.

We are in the middle of town and see merchants talking to security. We are in a bar called The Craig. We see an older 50 yr old female bartender that looks worn out but they need to have a bar in town and bartending clearly isn’t her preferred profession. Jamison asks her for a whiskey and she swiftly pours one for 2 silver. He tries to chat her up but she sucks at small talk just like the real Dia. Jamison is trying to flirt and learns her name is Mary, she has a real awkward handshake. The handshake of a 60 yr old. QUEEF’S QUEST.

The party outside is yelling Queef Quest, the whole bar hears us, and Jamison decides to leave, he tips 4 copper. Jamison uses Thomaturgy to yell at the party, he draws even more attention to the party, great job Dia. Bronson whispers to Jamison that this was supposed to be a stealth mission. We continue through the spine, inside the mountain area, we see rocks and cliffs around us. We see a narrow path on the edge of the mountain that can barely fit our cart.

Mogali sends big budgie to fly and watch Boblin the Goblin and kill him if he fucks up at all. Everyone other than Bronson decide to tie rope to each other so they can catch somebody if they fall. Bronson climbs up the walls to see farther ahead, he notices a hairpin turn followed by a canyon. Bronson does a perception check and notices two birds high up in the air. Bronson alerts Big Budgie and Mermista of the birds. Mermista creates a fog to block the birds’ view. As this happens, Ohm and Mermista lose their footing and start to fall. Mogali and Furtim successfully save Ohm and Mermista from falling. We notice someone in the distance cloaked and up high that is watching us. Mogali convinces Boblin to go and approach the cloaked figure while still being tied up. Boblin just starts sprinting, Jamison and Mogali try to shoot him and fail. Mermista throws a dart at Boblin’s achilles tendon and he just screams bloody murder and the birds just start screeching.

We roll initiative!!!!!

As we look ahead these two giant eagles have noticed our presence. Furtim and Mermista aid Bronson, he yells HE’S JUST AN ISLAND BOOOIIIIIIII!!!! He casts chromatic orb at Eagle 1 for 16 lightning damage. Eagle 2 dive bombs towards Bronson, Bronson uses his Island BOI defense to block both attacks easily. Jamison fires his shortbow and the sun gets in his eyes and misses. Mogali attacks with his light crossbow and yells ISLAND BOI and hits Eagle 1 for 11 damage and Eagle one just falls into the distance and dies. Big Budgie misses Eagle 2. Boblin is crawling away trying to hide.

Furtim does Vicious Mockery at Eagle 2 and fails. Mermista tries to launch Jamison at Eagle 2 with her Create Water and she creates a platform under Jamison and projects him to the next cliff level. Bronson pulls out his sword and stabs Eagle 2 for 7 damage. Bronson uses action surge and stabs it again for another 9 damage. Eagle 2 attacks Bronson twice and fails. It flies away towards the weird screaming creature that we don’t know what it is. Jamison is furious and sprints towards Boblin and stabs him through the chest and he screams “This isn’t over!!!”. Mogali dashes upwards. We hear a guttural scream, on the cliff above us is a 15 ft tall Ettin double headed giant screaming at us for killing his pets.

## Session 5

> 11/30/21 _Dinner Guests_

Combat resumes… Furtim dashes towards the battle. Dia drinks an aged marshmallow seltzer, as fine as a milf. Mermista heads towards her beloved Bronson and dashes past him towards the Ettin. Bronson rushes upwards, and casts firebolt, and hits for 3 fire damage. Eagle 2 attacks Jamison and crit fails, it tries again and guts him with its claws for 11 damage. The Eagle tries to fly away but J hits with an opportunity attack and slashes it for 7 damage. J dashes upwards while holding in his innards while stealth. Mogali dashes upwards towards the battle. Lil Budgie dashes towards J and Bro. Big Budgie flies upward and attacks Eagle 2 and shoots chicken bones shrapnel into E2 and murders it. The Ettin screams in rage seeing his second pet die. Ohm is at the bottom of hill, farthest away from the battle screaming about his AC, everyone is confused. Ohm dashes and casts Toll of the Dead, but the Ettin shakes it off. The giant with 2 heads towards Mermista and swings with a club and hits for 14 damage. It swings with a battleaxe and hits her again for 5 damage.

Furtim runs towards E and casts Vicious Mockery and yells that he’s coming for those bird eggs as he gives him the double bird and hurts his feelings for 4 damage. He also gives Bardic Inspiration to Mermista. Mermista attacks with her staff for 7 damage as he cries out in pain. She then punches him in the heart for 4 damage. She uses Flurry of Blows for another 4 damage to the neck. Bronson sprints towards M and the Ettin and steps in between them, he fails with his Chromatic Orb but uses his Action Surge to Slash his hamstring for 14 damage. Jamison eats his Panang Curry and comes out of stealth and shoots E with his short bow for 10 damage. Mogali moves forward and shoots his crossbow for 9 damage in the shoulder and he actually starts to look fucked up. LB moves towards Mermista and BB shoots at E for 6 shrapnel damage. Ohm dashes forward and the casts Healing Word on J and heals him for 7 health. The Ettin attacks Bro with his club and Bro blocks with his shield. E attacks Bro again with his battleaxe and misses. The Ettin tries to run away but incurs an OA from Mer and Bro. Mer hits with her staff in the dick for 11 damage, Bronson winces because she’s done it to him before. Bro hits him with his sword. Bronson also aims for the cock with his sword and screams Mazel Tov! he hits a cock artery and the Ettin bleeds out and dies. Mogali takes an ear from Boblin’s corpse and Ohm steals the other one.

A pool of blood surrounds the dead Ettin, and 2 dead eagles are strewed among the mountain. We see a cave at the top of the mountain where the Ettin resided. Furtim CRITS when we look to see where that shadowy figure was that was watching us, he can tell that whoever was here made a mad dash towards the town, he learns that is a small humanoid like figure was running back towards the town. As we continue up the mountain we see the cave and the nests of the eagles. We only see one nest 2 BIRDS ONE NEST. We see 2 eggs with brown spots, Furtim snatches them up. F inspects the cave and sees remnants of the caravans that went missing, he finds 100 gold, 10 silver, and 40 copper and he also finds a weird form of goggles with 2 crystal lenses, made of gold. Furtim puts the goggles in his scramble eggs pockets and J calls him out, he hands them to J covered in eggs. But F uses Identify and puts on his eggy goggles, and notices something weird, he can see super farther than before, while wearing them you have advantage on wisdom/perception checks. They are The Eyes of the Eagles. As he grabs these, Mermista is pretty hurt, but we make it up the path. Ohm casts Prayer of Heal on the party, Mermista and Jamison and they are fully healed. It gets colder, and its getting snowier and windier. We see 2 high towers in the local town and a group of queen’s guard in blue and silver trim.

Jamison runs ahead to talk to the Queen’s Guard, they tell them they’re happy they made it. He asks if they’re here for The Summit? The guard tells us to follow them, the party follows. F asks if they have any knowledge on a person that just arrived with smaller footprints, they said they do not know of anyone. Ohm notices that the atrium area has a higher than usual amount of fully armored Queen’s Guard. We are brought into the main courtyard of The Deep. We see more QG but also mercenaries of all races. Behind them we see a ILC banner that was red with a black cross and a wreath. When we go into the Great Hall we see the most massive fire pit that is 4 stories tall. There’s one table and a bunch of diplomats from the kingdom. At the right table you see members from the ILC as representatives.

## Session 6

> 12/7/21 *Volatile Negotiations*

On the left side of the room is the Queen’s Guard with humans, goliaths, elves; on the right is the ILC with orcs, dwarves, humans and elves.  A giant snow badger pelt resides between the 2 great tables.  We are entering the room and the area is being prepped, a lot of tension is in the room between the 2 sides.  Ohm does a perception check on the food spread, the main courses haven’t arrived but he sees some snacks set up for the guards.  Ohm heads over to the area of the room with the dwarves and ale barrels.  As he walks over he feels people staring at him.  Mogali asks one of the guards where our rooms are so we can freshen up.  A female guard in queen’s guard armor with a scar down the side of her face, Bridgette, wants to know what we’re doing here, she has a giant silver spear.  Mogali crit fails on deceiving her and Bridgette says our name is not on the list.  Bronson shows her the wine soaked letter from the queen and she wonders why we’re here instead of the Wizards’ College.  We told her this was the fastest way to the college.  She tells her guards to search the town to make sure there are no other surprise guests.

Bridgette explains that the ILC is attacking them with guerilla warfare and they are losing a lot of lives on both sides... MAGICAL VIETNAM. They are having the Summit tomorrow, we have free reign of the town but we are not allowed to leave.  Bridgette tells she is second in command, only to Sigurd.  Mermista tells her that we are friends with him, and she says she misses him, she writes him but he doesn’t reply. Mermista wants to tell her that she is BARKING UP THE WRONG GAY TREE, but her persuasion roll fails and Bridgette says she has work to do.  Dia asks when we are getting a long rest, Rufio says it’s when we turn down, Bronson say repeats the ancient scripture of Saint Lil John and replies TURN DOWN FOR WHHHAAAATTTT?!?!?!?!.
Mogali goes to his room and says he’s doing “spirit” stuff.  Mermista, Ohm, and Furtim head towards the kitchen. Jamison and Bronson head towards the dorms, as they make their way through the kitchen they yell “behind” because they know how kitchens work.  Bronson gets inspiration from Rufio.  We notice nobody is in the dorms but the staff that live there notice we aren’t from there so we leave the room to not raise suspicion.  Furtim brings his eagle eggs to the kitchen. He approaches a chef to cook eggs for him.  Furtim gets the chef to cook his two giant eagle eggs with his impressive roll. Chef J directs the sous chefs to cook both eagle eggs, since they’re a delicacy. J and B head towards the bar in the town.

Mogali finishes his spirit stuff, and now Air Budgie is no longer just a pile of trash but flesh and bone and AB has a beak and a bunch of eyes and perches upon his head. Lil Budgie is still a dog-shaped pile of trash. J and B see AB and B is unfazed and still recognizes him as a friend. J is freaked the fuck out and tries to pet it but Mogali says it’s a terrible idea.  Air Budgie leaves Mogali and rests on Jamison’s shoulder.  Mog tries to make some wine and crit fails again and everyone is avoiding eye contact from him. B, J and AB go into town.

We notice some ILC members in town that are far outnumbered by QG.  We notice the local tavern and enter.  As the door closes we notice it’s very warm and very awkward with the tension between the local townspeople and QG and ILC members.  We see the head bartender, a female Tiefling.  Jamison casts Detecting Thoughts on the bartender, Mina,  as J closes his eyes, the bartender wavers a bit and J is in her mind.  She has a lot of anxiety, a thought goes through her mind “they can’t do this, it’s going to be a massacre!”.  She knows the ILC has something planned but she doesn’t know the exact details.  J tells Bro immediately about her reading the mind of the Tiefling.  Bronson looks for some drunk ILC members, but he notices one human ILC member that is hunched over and is a little fucked up.  He tries to convince to take a shot with him; it fails.  Jamison goes to the bartender and starts chatting her up since they are both Tieflings.  J asks for a drink and is as terrible at flirting as Dia.  Mogali can see everything and tells Air Budgie to bail since this flirting was disastrous.  J asks about the ILC in the corner and Mina is clearly uncomfortable.

Mogali sees this cringefest and enters the bar.  He uses Shamu a spirit we haven’t seen before to talk telepathically to Jamison and coach J how to talk to Mina.  J just keeps repeating the word Massacre and CRITS, Mina just freaks out and asks J what he knows.  She signals J, AB, Mog, and Bro to follow her out back.  She is confused because she thinks we work for the Queen we assure we do not, she tells us the QG are planning on killing all of the townspeople and ILC, but the ILC have a contingency plan.  She tells us we can’t tell anyone or she’s dead.  We head back to our rooms.

Furtim is being treated by Chef J since he rolled so well and they are treating him like an mvp.  He sees the best fried and scrambled eggs he’s ever seen and the best eggies in a basket.  Furtim slices a piece of each dish and puts them in his pocket and offers the rest to the kitchen staff.  Chef J starts to weep at this kind gesture because everyone else has treated him like the staff his whole life.  Furtim tries to ask him what’s going on with this Summit, he has won over everyone and Chef J tells him a month ago that the entire kitchen staff got replaced without any explanation.  Furtim and Chef J have an unspoken bond and give each other the nod.  We all meet up and exchange information about the potential attack from both sides and Furtim’s in with Chef J.

There’s a knock at the door, it’s Bridgette, her armor is removed, she is with a  high member of the ILC, they are both suspicious of us being in one room together.  We all return to our rooms for the evening.  Air Budgie follows Jamison since she is in the most danger because of how terrible her flirting was.  Furtim attunes to the Eyes of the Eagles by shoving eggs in his eyes.

## Session 7

> 12/16/21 *Rising Tensions*

We are all waking up again in the morning after a long rest.  We all head down to the kitchen for breakfast.  We see things more organized today, members in the ILC are more ceremonial/war ready. Queen’s guard are also more prepared and ready for discussions.  Furtim goes to Chef J and asks what the plan is for today.  He is yelling orders and is happy to see F, and tells him that the 3 course meal is going to be amazing. The first course is meat pies, the 2nd course is roast meat and veggies, and the 3rd course is a fruit soup.  F does a perception check and he notices the new wait staff doesn’t know their way around the kitchen.  F asks Chef J about the new staff.  Chef J assures him that they will do their job. Brad Pitt is NOT i REPEAT NOT JIZZING IN THE SOUP.

Jamison heads to the storage room and sees 2 of the kitchen staff, they question him but he is able to lie his way out of suspicion.  J does investigation to see if anything weird with the food, he looks in a barrel but one of the other chefs catches him and tells him to leave.

Mogali suggests that Furtim points out one of the new chefs and then we kidnap him and Jamison casts detect thoughts on him. Furtim casts Presdigitation to knock over the plates of the waiting staff to see who seems out of place and who knows how to handle the situation.  Chef J yells at the staff but this one waiter seems shook.  Jamison focuses on that waiter and convinces him to come up to the room with J.  As we do this, the first course has been delivered and people are getting ready to sit down.  Bronson goes in and grabs the waiter by his blonde hair and his tiny huevos (That’s Spanish for Eggs) and demands to know what the plan is to massacre the other side.  Jamison casts detect thoughts on him and the waiter can be heard thinking, we learn he is scared and confused but we can’t get anything else out of him.  Bronson sighs “Guess we gotta do this the old fashioned way…”, Mermista shoves the muffling rag into his mouth as she knows what’s about to happen.  He shoots him right in the nut sack without doing massive damage.  He let’s him know he better talk without screaming or else he will never reproduce.  He is sweating but has a spry smile and says that his ILC brothers will not let us out alive.  RUFIO FUCKS UP AND WE KNOW HE IS ILC.  Mermista moves everyone out of the way and NAT 20S she pulls out her pouch of water and she suffocates him until he is unconscious. Mogali checks his pockets and finds 2 silver and a small vial of milky white liquid. Furtim casts Identify on the vial, nothing magical about it.  As we are doing this we here a knock on the door saying that they are getting ready.  Bronson says that he nicked his nuts while shaving and that he’ll need a minute.

We head downstairs and Furtim shapeshifts into the waiter, Bronson nuts into a vial just in case we need a backup vial.  Bridgette knocks on the door and Mogali swears there’s a situation, he fails but we start walking with her.  Mog uses his Shamu ability to telepathically tell her about the poison vial and the chef.  Halfway down the stairs B turns to Mog and she snaps and the guards leave, she says “Don’t speak of this to another soul” and we continue down the stairs. Furtim heads to the kitchen disguised as the waiter.

Bridgette asks where Furtim is, we say he had some bad eggs.  Bridgette is so busy she says she expects to see him later.  We see this human woman with long white hair, we can’t tell her age, she takes her seat in the middle of the table across from Bridgette.

Furtim is in the kitchen and tries to see if he notices any more poison vials, but he doesn’t see anything.  He walks up to Chef J and convinces him that he needs him in the storage closet.  He slightly closes the door and shifts back into Furtim, he lets him know that there is a plot to poison the Queen’s Guard and that he will be liable if things go south and he shows him the vial. Chef J is trying not to scream from freaking out at seeing him shape shift, but he keeps his composure and demands to know where he found that milky vial.  CJ smells the vial but he doesn’t know what is in the vial.  He says he will keep an eye out for anything suspicious.

Bridgette clears her throat and announces the beginning of the peace talks.  Some people point to our party and ask why we are here.  Bridgette responds that they are neutral and we saved one of the ILC members.  Somebody from the wait staff gasps in awe.  We pay special attention to the woman with the long hair, Abigail Winthrop of the ILC, Bridgette’s counterpoint.  Arguments begin and they flip a coin to see who goes first and the Kingdom goes first.

The Kingdom (Bridgette) declares there is no need for these baseless attacks by the ILC and calls them terrorist attacks. They warn they will do whatever it takes to save their kingdom.  Abigail rises up, she is gives off this sense of authority, she says that ever since she was a child that the kingdom has never done anything to help them and they have always been tyrants.  They look down upon people in the east, they only care about their name and their interests.  They work her people to death and yet they are called the monsters.  She claims the QG had been holding goblin hunts for sport since they are less intelligent beings

Bridgette asks them to be united as one kingdom.  Bronson does a history check on the alleged goblin hunts that both sides are arguing about.  He knows that these are real events that have happened.  The second course comes out, a woman with a shaved head and high collar brings out the second course but Mermista notices that she has an ILC tattoo on her wrist.  Furtim does a perception check on the rest of the staff but he doesn’t notice anything out of sorts.  As the food is placed Abigail asks us what we think about all of this.  Mermista calls out this server’s tattoo in front of Ohm and Mogali.

Mogali speaks up and tries to keep the peace amongst everyone.  Abigail says the only protection they need is from the Kingdom itself.  As all of this is happening both sides have been eating their food.  Both sides have been checking in on the kitchen.  Mog asks Bri what the Kingdom is offering the ILC to stop their attacks.  Bri says they’re willing to admit their wrongdoings from before but their terrorist attacks need to stop.  Mog asks what the trade situation is like.

Ohm reaches for his ale and brings it to his lips and looks directly at the dwarf that he interacted with earlier, no reaction.  Mog tells Bri she should set up some solid trade routes for the people in the east to gain their faith.  Bri admits that they have failed at supplying the towns to the far east, she wants to establish trust and trade routes with them.  Both sides take a 5 minute recess.  Ohm walks over to the other dwarf that was staring at him and asks him what’s up.  He says it’s odd to see a dwarf working for the kingdom since he is friendly with Bridgette.  He tells him he is only loyal to dwarves, the fire forge and Grox, the other dwarf is happy to hear it and fills Ohm’s mug with ale.  Ohm and the other dwarf cheers and they both drink in solidarity.

The meetings resume and they ask us if we have noticed anything particular from either side.  Ohm asks the QG why they have no dwarves.  Bri winces at the hard question, and she gives a bullshit answer about wanting to correct it in the future.  Bri loses her cool and says that the kingdom can wipe them out at any time should they want to.  Mogali uses Shamu to telepathically reach out to Abigail and tell her that he’s her best mate and that he believes in her side.  She clearly got his message but she does not move a muscle. She telepathically tells him that she appreciates him fighting for her side but the other side are monsters and they need to be dealt with.  He warns her maybe nobody should be poisoned here.  She laughs at the idea of poison, and tells him that she will have their own way of securing their freedom.  Mog relays what she said to the rest of the party.

Mermista calls out Bri for losing her cool, she yells about how many good people they have lost due to their terrorist attacks in the shadows.  Mog connects with Abigail again and lets her know that we just want to cross the mountains to get to Hogwarts and what can we do to help her to allow it, he rolls really shitty.  She tells Mogali not to worry but that they will all see us soon eventually.  Furtim casts minor illusion and a whistle sound comes from the other side of the room and a giant phoenix appears and bursts into smaller phoenixes,  Jamison uses Thomaturgy to help with the distraction for us to escape.  All of a sudden somebody screams “That’s the Signal!!!!” As time seems to slow down, the ground below begins to swell up as a huge explosion erupts from the storage room.  Everyone except Mog and Ohm are prone and take 5 damage. We see a figure tell us to come with him (Probably that Fuck from the Mountain), and Bridgette is trapped under a beam reaching for us begging for help.  FIN

## Session 8

> 1/4/22 *A Burning Decision*

We are left with the decision to help Bridgette or follow the shadowy figure towards the exit.  Mogali decides to use lil Budgie to help Bridgette and Jamison assists, they rush over and pick up the smoldering beam off to the side.  Mog and Jam high five.  The shadowy figure dashes out of the building as soon as we help Bridgette.  As Brig stands up we can hear sword fighting and armor on armor clashing into each other.  J runs out the castle looking for the unknown figure, but she cannot see him, but she sees 2 sides fighting each other and one side is clearly winning but J can’t figure out who is who.

As Brig stands up she braces herself in the doorway and sees the fighting b/w the ILC and QG, she pulls out a short sword and starts fighting the ILC.  We decide to leave the building and roll ATH.  Bronson runs and grabs Mermista’s hand and signals the rest of the party to form a chain and Bro deftly dodges all the debris and enemies while dragging the chain.  Furtim did the worst so he is at the end of the chain.  Furtim does a Dex Save and just barely dodges a passing blade by his face in all of the fighting.  As we make are way out we pass Bri, and she asks us where we are going and demands we fight for the queen. We peace the fuck out into the courtyard.

As we near the bar, Furtim notices that it is starting to catch fire and people are pouring out of the bar fighting each other.  He sees the ILC is overwhelmed but the kingdom is caught off guard and it is at a tipping point.  Bro and Mermista try to use shape water and we try to put out the fire at the bar,  Mermista gracefully summons up the water and puts out several fires.  Bronson attempts to use his Spanglish water shaping abilities after picking it up from Mermista and gets barely a squirt to put out a tiny leaf.  Mer shakes her head and Bro is overjoyed, “TEAMWORK!”.

Furtim and Jamison plan on trying to scare the fighters by F playing his zulcoon and J using Thometergy to change the color of the flames, give him a booming voice, and shake the ground.  Both sides hate each other so much that they don’t really pay attention to their performance.  We look for horses while Bro runs back to the stables to save Choncho and Badonkadonk,  he grabs the reins and they are freaking out but Bronson calms them down and he mounts Choncho and leads Badonkadonk back towards the rest of the party.

We see Bri run her sword through an ILC member’s throat and Abigail crushes the ribs of a QG member.  We all flee towards the small opening in the spiked fence towards the West and the Wizard’s College.   Mermista grabs Ohm and uses Step of the Wind to make their way to the opening, Bro rushes with the burros.  Bridgette is now bloodied and sees us running and tells the QG to stop us, they notice Mogali running in the back and sends a bunch of men after us on our way to Hogwarts.  We are all in a cart being carried to safety by our beloved Choncho and Badonkadonk.  WE ROLL FOR INITIATIVE.

We are on a straight path with no cover, the guards are chasing us down the hill, the guards are throwing javelins at us.  One heads straight for Ohm and just barely misses his neck, a spear heads for Mermista and misses, another javelin justs misses Mogali as he jumps into the cart.  Jamison gets caught by a spear in the cheek and takes 2 damage.  Mermista uncaps a waterskin, uses shape water to create a wall of ice and takes out three horses and guards.  Ohm throws a torch and casts Thomaturgy and tries to scare the horses but they Nat 20’d and are completely unphased.  Bronson is steering both steeds and he grabs the reins with one hand and his other hand glows as a fire bolt explodes from his hand and lands at the feet of 4 guards and they burst into flames.  Bro uses his action surge and he turns around riding his burros backwards and fires another fire bolt and CRITS and a massive explosion takes out 13 guards.  Furtim uses Eldritch Blast at the remaining 3 guards, Eldritch energy just bursts out of his wrists but the guards are ready for it and dodge at the last second.  Jamison fires his short bow and misses the group.  Mogali aims a crossbow and with deadly accuracy and nails one of the horses and it collides into the remaining 3 guards.

A massive war horse starts to catch up with us, and Bridgette is riding it while covered in blood, she carries her shortsword and hunts us down.  Mog tells Lil Budgie that we can always rebuild him and sends him on a suicide mission to take out the war horse, Mog just throws him off the cart, LB makes a war cry and is determined to succeed. Bri’s war horse just tramples LB as if it were a bug.  Bri takes out a crossbow and fires at Choncho, The Party is furious.

Mermista fucking CRITS and she creates an ice cube of water with spikes and just smashes into Bri’s shoulder doing 6 damage.  Ohm casts Toll the Dead on Bri, he raises his war hammer and shield, the shield’s eye starts glowing and Ohm smashes his hammer into the eye of the shield, she barely notices anything but still takes 2 damage.  Bronson uses Chromatic Orb with the assist from Air Budgie, he is enraged, his body starts to crackle with lightning, a giant orb of lightning just explodes and discharges as it fucks up Bri and sends her back 10 feet for 19 damage.  Furtim casts Dissonant Whispers 2nd Level at Bri, he whispers into his hand and this dark energy egg heads for Bri but she is highly trained and ignores the spell.  Fur gives J Bardic Inspiration.  J fires her shortbow and beautifully strikes Bri in the chest for 6 damage.  Mogali fires his crossbow but Bri is ready for it and dodges.  AB gives Bro the assist again.

Bridgette catches up to Choncho and attacks and hits our sweet angel for 5 damage with her sword. She attacks him again but he dodges because she’s just a stupid dirty bitch and Choncho is a legend. Mermista attacks with her staff and misses. She uses Flurry of Blows and misses both punches. Ohm uses Toll the Dead again but Bri shakes it off. Bronson starts leaking this caustic liquid and creates an orb of acid and smashes it into Bridgette’s face. Her skin starts to melt off of her face and she is really fucked up and she falls back 10 feet. Furtim casts Unsettling words on Bri and tells her she’s making a big mistake and this isn’t her fight. Jamison attacks with his shortsword and CRIT FAILS, HOW EMBARRASSING!. Mogali shoots Bri with his crossbow pointblank, the bolt carries her off the horse, what we can tell of her acid face is pure anger. Mogali throws out a memory from his head to the back of the cart towards Bri. We reach the bottom of the hill and we are no longer being chased.

We reach the desert town of Batvn and we get to the town’s gates, we see 2 guards decked out in Black and Red. FIN

## Session 9

> 1/11/22 *Blood on the Sands*

We arrive all bloodied, and Choncho is hurt, the guards could see us and asks us what happened.  We tell them that the Queen’s Guard chased us all the way down and we barely escaped.  They say we need to speak to the captain, but we tell them we are quite tired and could really use a nice LONG REST. Mogali nails his persuasion roll and we get led through the town.  Everything is brightly colored but it is a wasted land made of sand  and clay. The roads are immaculate, and there is a vast mix of races in this busy town.   We can’t tell which store is what since they are written in a different language, all we notice is that it’s busy.

Bronson carries Choncho above his arms as if he were a baby and he is freaking out asking for a doctor.  A mysterious gnome appears and says to follow him, the crew follows him in order to heal Choncho as fast as possible.  We arrive at a tavern, “The Red Roof Tavern”, we go through the swinging doors, it’s kind of grimy, there are 2 bartenders and 4 guys smoking hookah.  The gnome runs up to the bartender asking for James, he says he brought customers.  Bro demands the finest Donkey Doctor in the land, James says he does do a bit of animal healing, he tells us to meet him out back.  Jamison buys a round of shots. Bro asks the gnome what his name is, he replies Stomes.  Jamison starts talking up one of the bartenders, they tell him that it’s been really slow lately.  They said that everything has been tense with the ILC and the outerworld, Jamison lies his way out of telling him where we are from.  The bartender starts talking about a coworker that went down to work at Porto Puneta and instantly Mer says that’s her home and Bro says he’s worked down there before.  The bartender instantly warms up to the crew.

Ohm leaves the tavern and walks around the town, he can hear a hammer striking iron in the distance.  He sees the forgemaster is a fellow dwarf, but he notices inside the store a dark figure with a cloak duck into the alley to the right as soon as Ohm enters.  Ohm tries to chase him and CRITS and sprints after him, he swings his hammer at him to knock him over but doesn’t swing accurately but still manages to trip the hooded figure.  The hood comes off and Ohm discovers that it is the Little Boy we saved from being executed in Rothelm.  He tries to run away but trips and Ohm grabs a hold of him and starts interrogating him.  The boy tells us he’ll be ILC until he dies.  Ohm tries to intimidate him and asks why he is following us, he says he was told to by somebody.  Ohm persuades him to tell us that it was the Old Man and The Crone that sent him to spy on us because we were sent to harm them.  He tells us he knows we met with the Queen and that we were yelling Queen’s Quest. Ohm tries to lie but fails miserably.  The boy tells Ohm he’s hard to miss since there aren’t many dwarves left around Batvn.  Ohm inquires about the missing dwarves and he discerns that the ILC knows who is responsible but the boy himself does not know.  Ohm reminds him that we saved him and starts using plumbing metaphors to defend us working for the queen.  The kid is confused but he accepts the fact that we are just mercenaries and not necessarily working for the Queen.

Ohm and the boy head back towards the tavern.  James and Bro are in the back taking care of Choncho and he asks what happened.  Bro says that we were peacefully making our way down the pass and all of the sudden a ton of QG attacked us.  Bro successfully lies to James and James heals Choncho with moss.  Bro caresses sweet Choncho as he is getting worked on, and he calms down and knows everything will be ok.  James tells us that the QG will just attack anyone these days.  James offers us free room and board since we’ve been through so much.  Ohm walks in with the boy and Mogali recognizes him instantly and says he has his family’s lucky rock that he got from his little brother.  He softens instantly and asks how his little brother is doing.  Mogali sneaks the boy a shot, the boy drinks it and spits it out everywhere.

Bro asks the bartender who are the big wigs in town, we can tell he is pro ILC, he says random ILC members are always in charge and it rotates.  He said he’s heard whispers of ILC members being put into chain gangs and being hung after being caught.  Ohm asks him what the situation is in town between the Queen followers and the ILC followers.  He said the blockades have gotten everyone pissed at the Queen and they’d rather “Bleed Red than Wear Blue”.  Mog signals the boy to follow him to his room and to gather as much trash as he can carry, the boy follows him.  Furtim asks him what the current problems are in town, he replies that there are trade disputes between local markets, and rumors some ruins found in the badlands south of Batvm. About a day and a half away, and he says he can introduce us to a guy later that knows more about it.  He also mentions weird stuff happening at the Wizards College, saying that nobody has come down from there in a really long time, weeks in fact.  Also a weird guy came in saying that he noticed smoke coming from the town we came from.  Furtim casts Suggestion on the bartender and tells him that if anyone comes in asking about our party, he should say we are nobody.  Ohm is the only one that notices the spell being cast on him by Furtim.  Furtim performs with his Zulcoon for the bar and people seem to enjoy it.  We take a LONG REST.  Bro bonds with both of his weapons.

Mogali and the Boy are building a new Lil Budgie out of trash like father and son.  As soon as the trash dog is complete Mog kicks him out of his room.  The Boy thanks him before he leaves, Mog tells him to be ready in case we need him again.  As Ohm is asleep, he hears the sound of a roaring fire, a sound of a hammer, it rings his entire core.  As he opens his eyes, he sees a giant glowing eye, it stares at him and says one dwarvish word, “AVENGE”.  Ohm wakes up and it’s the next day.

It is the next morning, Mog wakes up with new and improved Lil Budgie, they tag along with Jamison to town. Bro and Mer follow.  Furtim goes down to the tavern to ask if anybody has asked about us.  Ohm looks for an armorer.  As we get downstairs, it gets quiet, everyone has noticed our group.  Sitting at the bar is the kid (JACOB) and he notices that we’re awake, he calls for James as we want breakfast.  Furtim gets the vibe that people are giving us side glances.  James comes out with eggs, bacon and breakfast beers.  Furtim investigates the room while holding his pocket eggs, people notice him eating them, but they’ve seen weirder, but clearly people have been talking about us.  Furtim informs the party of his suspicions. We leave for the town and Jacob jumps off his stool and tells us he’ll be our escort for the day to keep an eye on us.  Jamison intimidates Jacob using Thometergy, but Jacob tells us that he can be useful to us. He tells us he can introduce us to Habet.  We tell him to take us to Habet, but he is unavailable at the moment. We let him follow us into town.

Ohm goes looking for armor. He finds the blacksmith and sees he is another dwarf. Ohm is so shocked he can’t even speak. Ohm rolls 21 perception. It seems like he knows what he is doing. Ohm inquires about making armor with the blacksmith dwarf. Ohm is still in shock. Mogali demands to help him make flat 10 bolts for his cross bow. The blacksmith charges 5 gold pieces for this. Air Budgie is going with Jamison, Furtim, Mermista and Bronson.

Jamison sees a woman outside of the blacksmith. This woman is directly staring and smiling at him. Furtim, Mermista and Bronson are just hoping he won’t try to start flirting with her. They simply can’t relive that. She asks James what he’s doing. “The queen asks what are you doing”. James rolls a nat 20 for deception. Jam starts flirting with her. She tells us the Queen wants to know what happened at the Deep. The woman slides a tooth into Jamison’s hand that is clearly from a dragon born, root and all (Nessa?!?!?!). Jam chases after her but loses her. We have a strong feeling that it belongs to Nessa. Jam tries to find somebody in town that can contact the Queen as he is very worried. He gets set for a meetup later that night. Mermista asks Mogali about any trinkets that could help raise her AC.

Furtim CRITS as he is looking for new instruments in town, he finds one of the best music stores in the world in town, “Bard’s Collage”. Fur goes in talking about Zulcoons, the hipster employee is in love with him and takes to the back to look at his “Private Collection”. Fur is looking for one with a fresh duck on top, bagpipes on one side, limited edition. All of the sudden he sees one glowing on the wall, he needs to have it, 20 gold. Fur tries to shred on the Zulcoon to get a discount, he gets a pity discount for 18 gold because he tried really hard. Furtim also buys a backup Erhu (Asian Guitar), and he gets a bonus ticket for a free instrument at another location. Mog gets his custom bolts. Ohm asks the sexy blacksmith for splint mail by tonight, but it will cost him 250 gold to get it done in such a hurry. Ohm remembers he has a giant stash of gold from a job he did in the past with Jamison. Ohm pays the dwarf and winks at him. Mogali created a Barrier Tattoo to give to Mermista to help raise her AC, she requests a Tsunami Wave that wraps around her arm with gold flakes at the tip of the waves, based on the Sun God, Poti. Mermista doesn’t even flinch as she gets the tattoo. All of the sudden she can hear the voice of Young Poti, an obnoxious mumble rapping young God, and he introduces himself to her.

We head back to the Red Roof Tavern, Furtim goes ahead of the group and enters first, he opens the door he doesn’t notice much other than it’s quiet. Jam leads the crew and enters the bar, noticing nothing. Mermista enters the bar and stops instantly, there is nobody in the bar and only one bartender. At the main table there is a Tiefling male and a goliath 8 ft tall, both in black and red armor. The Tiefling says “The name’s Habet, pleasure to meet you.” FIN

## Session 10

> 1/18/22 *A Shifting of Sands*

Jamison asks who the Tiefling is, he replies “Habet, I’m in charge for the time being, you guys sure took your time.”  Jam asks what he wants from us, “information mostly.”  Mogali asks for a beer first, James is behind the bar.  Mog does a perception check on James, he gets a dirty 20, but he can tell James is very uncomfortable.  Mog demands a large beverage and gets one.  Habet mentions that he heard we caused quite the scene at The Deep and that we might be on a Queen’s Quest.  Furtim tells him that’s not true at all and that he is a famous Zulcoon player and the rest of the party are his band (Furtim and the Pocket Eggs).  Fur rolled great but there is just too much information on us.  Jam yells for Jacob to come over here as he suspects Jacob might’ve snitched but he swears he didn’t.  Mog calls him over to him as he can tell he is frightened.

Bronson corrects Habet and tells him if we were really on a Queen’s Quest, then why would we have hurled a giant ball of acid in the Queen’s Guard’s leader’s face.  We inform him we are heading to the Wizard’s College.  Furtim hears Habet whisper “She can’t reach them either.”  Clearly nobody can reach the Wizard’s College.  Habet tells his crew to leave, and asks us when we are leaving. Bro tells him if he wants to aid us on our quest we are willing to accept magic items.  Bro successfully persuades him and he says he’ll help us for an exchange of information.  He’s tells us to look for Mortimer.  The bar guests start funneling back in and Jamison is furious and wants information on Nessa.

Jam all of the sudden feels a caress on his ear and it turns out it’s the redhead who gave her Nessa’s tooth earlier.  Jam tries to intimidate her, she says he’s no fun, and that nothing has happened to her friend yet.  Jam storms off and the redhead disappears.  Jam realizes that she must be an imperial spy judging by her actions.  Jamison heads back towards the bar.

Mog asks Jacob what he knows about Habet, he runs the entire area, they call him Habet the Efficient.  He’s fair but strict, Mog hands Jac some copper pieces and to help us out tomorrow as Mog retires to his room.  Jac puts on his hood and leaves the bar.  Furtim decides to play his new Erhu and lays down some tasty tunes, the crowd goes wild as they have never heard this type of music before.  The guests reward Fur 34 silver pieces for introducing Throat Singing Metal to their world.  Ohm leaves the bar and heads back to the sexy dwarf armorer to pick up his Platemail.  The blacksmith goes to the back and carries out a granite looking box, with the seal of the shop on it and his initials on the side.  Ohm thanks him and does a stone cutting history check on the granite box, he realizes it’s a lot lighter than it should be, his clan is from the desert and the stone there is much lighter.  Ohm tries it on and it feels amazing to be back in Dwarven made armor.  Ohm is fully erect. The BS asks him what clan Ohm is from, he replies a much older clan, the Fire Forge clan.  The BS looks down and says my condolences. Ohm invites him to watch BeastStars at his place some time soon.

Mermista and Bronson go shopping for potions, they go to an underground bizarre and find a shop with a bright blue sign that looks like a potion shop.  They enter the shop and they see a humanoid female with long hair and their back turned to us.  Mer approaches and notices she has elven ears and flowers and she asks what we are looking for. Mer says we are looking for potions of healing, she pulls out a crate with red vials in it.  Bro tries to persuade her with offering her a threesome, she is not enthused and tells us they are 70 gold a piece.  Bronson glances at Mer as if we should get out of here.  She offers us potions of healing for 15 silver a piece but Bro doesn’t trust her so we both try it and it seems to work.  Bro skeptically watches Mer buy 12 potions for 18 gold.  She thanks Mermista and gives Bro a very dirty look.  They return to the Tavern.

Mermista finds the bartender that knows of Porto Puneta, and asks him about Mortimer, the one that Habet recommended.  He tells us he works in the sand fields, always building things, he says he’s a good guy just weird.  Mer asks where we can find him, he says we have to go South of here to find him, and he draws a crude little map showing us how to get to Morty’s place.  Mer offers to buy Samuel a shot and he gladfully accepts. Mer and Bronson go upstairs to bump uglies.

Mermista begins to have a dream, she’s on the coast of Porto Puneta in the water, at dusk. She feels one with the ocean, Mer enjoys this and goes for a swim and glides effortlessly through the water. She looks up and notices a boat, she develops a sense of dread, and she realizes the boat is using a type of night fishing technique. Mer does a stealth check, she passes the first one, and the second one, but on the third pass the light starts to head near her. On her 4th stealth check she gets a dirty 20, all of the sudden her skin starts to blend in with the water and they are one and the same, the light passes through her and she wakes up.

We all awaken the next morning and decide to head to Morty’s before we head down South to check out the ruins that we heard about. Mer is shooketh with the dream she had, Jamison is not in much better shape and he is so worried about Nessa.

Mer uses the map Samuel gave her to try and find Mortimer, 20 min go by before we realize we are going in circles. Furtim looks for anyone that might know about the ruins down south, he sees nothing. Ohm gives the map a whirl, he instantly realizes where we need to go, it takes another 20 minutes, then we arrive at the edge of the city, it is walled, there are dunes 50 ft high and it is just sand everywhere. We find stone buildings, and piles and piles of scrap, equations written all over the place. Mog recognizes that the math is correct but also chaotic, Mogali is in paradise with all the junk around. Mortimer answers the door and we tell him that Habet sent us and that we are heading south. As soon as he hears South, Morty swings open his door and invites us all in all excitingly.

We ask Mort to tell us everything we need to know about the South. He tells us that Dwarves used to live there and that there is massive amounts of treasure down there. Clearly he is so excited that we don’t care about the danger that awaits us and he has his own narrative. He asks us to bring back some dwarvish items to him so he can finish his research. Ohm does an insight check on Mort and can tell he has sent other adventurers to their doom. Ohm tries to lie and say that he knew some of the other adventurers and that he’s here to collect their payment. OHM CRITS and Mort is overwhelmed to know that somebody actually came back from the ruins. Ohm says his friend got addicted to Dweth (Dwarf Meth). Mog asks him what kind of experiments he is running. He says there is a rumor that there is a power source down in those ruins and he wants us to collect it.

Bronson asks him what sort of enemies and traps await us and what useful items he can give us to help us.  Morty clearly knows something but isn't telling us.  Bro demands he tells us what is waiting for us in the sand, HE CRITS.  Morty tells us to follow him as he leads us into this room.  Ohm notices a dead Bullette, a ground shark that digs through the ground.  Bro says he should know of some way to avoid them.  Morty unveils a sand canoe underneath a tarp.  There is a giant mast in the middle with a rope and pulley system.  He assures us that this time it will work, and he just wants us to live.  Jam tries to intimidate, he succeeds and Mort says the ruins are his life work but he is too afraid to go there.  We try to convince Mort to go with us.  Furtim tries to inspire him through music.  It’s more of a Nickelback performance and Mort is uninspired and walks away.  The crew talks about stealing the sand ship after we head down south. Furtim storms out after Morty ignores his song.  While Morty thinks it over he head into town real quick.  Bro heads into town and buys 3 chickens for 20 silver.  We decide to leave Choncho and Badonkadonk with Jacob.

We prepare to head out, Mogali will be our navigator, and Ohm will be our lookout.  Mortimer finally decides to come with us to the South. Morty is nervous, and a little excited. Jameson is worried about bringing him with us to the wizard’s college. Mogali suggests dumping him later. Morty brings 6 grains clay pots with him that he thinks will come in handy for our “friends” out there.

As Mogali is guiding us he just lets go and lets “The Spirits Take the Wheel”, as he successfully and safely leads us through.  Ohm is also super clutch with the perception checks.  But all of the sudden the DM asks Jamison to do a perception check and he notices nothing.  Bronson is hydrating during these times.  Ohm and Mogali are just nonstop crushing it with these nature and perception checks.  We are about halfway through the desert.  Mermista happens to notice a previous sand cruiser half covered in sand in the distance.  Morty starts crying a little bit and says “there’s been too many”.  We decide to be idiots and go investigate the shipwreck.

Mogali sends Air Budgie over to investigate the shipwreck, Mogali can see through AB’s eyes, but he can’t see anything definitive.  Mogali is convinced there is treasure.  We guide our ship over there, and Ohm and Mog get us there safely.  Mog sets down Lil Budgie to slowly walk over to the shipwreck, and he starts digging out the box.  Ohm starts to get a lil sleepy but still nothing gets past him and notices some rivets of dust kicking up, about 6 of them.  Mog and LB start to pull out a wooden case that is now free, and LB hurries back to the ship as the crew helps pull him up.  Bronson readies a chicken in his arms, we start to push off, Bronson throws the chicken towards the Bullettes. The chicken lands and starts running and all of the sudden the sand shifts from underneath and jaws just swallow the chicken as a couple of sand sharks jump up in the air.  Mog and Ohm are still safely guiding us through without drawing the attention of the sand sharks.  Ohm saw 6 sharks but he lost track of one, Mog doesn’t notice a rock in the sand and hits it and the ship makes noise and 5 sharks start heading towards us.  Mog throws Lil Budgie overboard to distract the sharks.

As LB dashes across the sand, we see sand sharks left and right just missing him until the last shark just bites into him and drags him under the sand. RIP LIL BUDGIE 2. Ohm and Mog go back to their good rolls. We see this colossal sand structure where the entrances alone are 50 ft across. It is absolutely massive and made entirely of Sandstone.  On our last roll Mog CRITS and finds the perfect place to land at the Sand Ruins.  Mog and Fur use their Mage Hands and use Bro’s crossbar to open it.  Meanwhile, Mortimer is absolutely mesmerized with all of the Sandstone Ruins. Bronson just grabs the crowbar and opens up the chest, in it are 4 rubies, writing material, maps, journals, and a feather.  Mogal CRITS and realizes the feather is unlike anything he’s seen, it’s blue and dark blue with white in the center, it looks like water and gives off the sense of water.  Furtim casts Identify on the feather, he can almost hear the waves crash, this is the Feather Token of Swan Boat, in a large body of water when the feather touches the water it turns into a 50 ft long self propelling Swan Boat that lasts for 24 hours and can be dismissed back into a feather.

Ohm learns about the history of the stone and can tell it’s a mixture of sand and limestone, is much lighter than it appears, he notices two giant hammers etched into the walls.  Bro investigates the maps, he strings together that this mission was a side quest.  Names and dates are from 3 months ago.  Bro does a history check and learns something but decides to keep it to himself and says he hasn’t found anything.  Ohm searches for an entrance and all of a sudden his shield starts to react. FIN

## Session 11

> 1/25/22 *The Forgotten*

We are at the entrance to a giant sand temple, doors are 50 ft tall.  It is a dwarven sand temple, the race died out years ago.  We SKILLFULLY dodged all of the sand sharks.  Ohm wakes up doing Capoeira.  We decide to camp out and take a long rest, as the dunes turn dark, there are pockets of salt stone that start glowing behind us.  This entire hallway is lit up, there are these giant pillars with a smaller doorway, 10 ft high.  Jamison and Bronson stand guard while the party rests.

Bronson goes towards the lights, he walks in the room with winds dancing across the sand outside, but as he walks in the room there is total silence.  The hall is massive, is shows sophisticated signs of carving from one giant piece of stone.  Lights are coming from the stones but we don’t know how. They look like himalayan salt pillars.  Bro does an arcana check on the stones, he doesn’t recognize this type of magic, but clearly the rocks grow naturally. Bro tries to signal Jamison but she thinks he might be having a seizure.  Bro thinks he gives him the OK signal and walks in.  There is dwarvish writing above the door, and a giant stone blocks the doorway.  Luckily Bronson speaks Dwarvish, it is old Dwarvish, it says “Work for me, I will protect you, I will keep you alive.”

Bronson dances as he walks back and he is so proud that he decided to study Dwarvish, Fuck You Mom and Dad for telling me to study Cellestial.  Bro tries to chip off part of the glowing rock to show the others, he chips off the chunk, it goes dim and then it starts to glow back to normal.  Bro brings it back to the tent and holds it awkwardly close to Ohm’s sleeping face.  Ohm wakes up and instantly grabs the rock, Bro speaks to him in Dwarvish and tells him about the door and the stone.  The rest of the party wakes up and is filled in.  Ohm does a history check on the writing, he’s heard it before as a chant in the mines, it’s a dwarven saying, part of a dwarven riddle.

We head towards the doorway, Mogali investigates the hall, there are these rough cutouts of dwarves doing some activity.  Ohm does a stone cutting check, he notices the finest craftsmanship of even dwarven standards.  It was the peak of their talent.  Morty is in tears as this is the Atlantis of dwarven finds. Ohm implies that this is sacred ground.  He sees in the glyphs that they are working on building the temple.  Mogali attempts to mimic the hieroglyphs in the same motion. Ohm joins in and they both do a Con Save, Mog kills it, and Ohm passes, they keep swinging.  Mog continues mining, he passes again, but starts to tire and sweat.  Jamison joins in, they’ve been going at it for a while and not much progress has been made.  Ohm starts to sweat and all of the sudden the ground starts to glow, their sweat activated the door.

We look in the chamber, it is oval shaped, with 2 halls on either side and a door to the north that resembles the door we just came through. Bro reads the north door, “Pain, Joy, Love”. We head to the east hallway, Bro has the shiny stone in his hand. As we get close there is a dwarven sculpture that is so detailed that it looks alive, it’s a dwarven male, he is bald, bearded with three braids, around him is this ornate necklace that is gold with 3 blue sapphires. Beneath the statue is scripture that says “I control you, are you me?, What am I?” Ohm sits in the same position as the sculpture, he mentally connects with it as it awaits his answer. Ohm does a perception check, he opens his eyes, he sees it’s an ancient dwarven philosopher, Grantitus. Ohm asks Bro if he’s heard of him, Bro knows that Grantitus was about the person himself and things relating to the brain. Ohm connects again to the sculpture, Mermista says “the mind”, Ohm repeats it, the statue’s beard unites and that necklace is now removable. Mermista does an Arcana check on the necklace, she recognizes it as the Medallion of Thoughts, it has 3 charges.

We now head to the west hall. Ohm checks for traps, notices nothing. We enter the room, in the center there’s a collection of rags, there is a chest in the middle of the room, vases, a scattering of gold across the room. Lil budgie 3 goes into the room and starts dancing around the chest, Furtim uses his mage hand to try and knock down one of the vases. He almost knocks it over. Lil budgie tries to tackle one of the vases, but nothing happens. Mogali enters the room, he ties a rope around his waist, Ohm joins him. Mog approaches the treasure chest, investigates, he sees a golden chest with dark wood, there is gold and clay, as he moves toward it, it shutters. Mog says out loud “This is definitely a rouge’s job, where is Jamison when you need it?” They walk back towards the party. Mog attacks with his crossbow, the top of the chest pops open, a giant purple long tongue comes out and we see giant teeth, IT’S A FUCKING MIMIC, AND A HORDE MIMIC. WE ROLL INITIATIVE!!!!! FIN

## Session 12

> 2/1/22 *It's Run its Course*

WE ROLL INITIATIVE!!!! Mermista CRITS and hits the Mimic with her quarterstaff for 8 damage, as she hits what she thinks is wood, it is sticky flesh and now her quarterstaff is stuck to the mimic.  She throws a dart at the mimic for 7 damage, she then uses Step of the Wind to disengage and runs out of range.  Mogali pulls a wooden jug and pops off the top and chugs it, it smells awful, underneath his mask and out the eyehole, Tasha’s Caustic Goo, goo spews out and covers both mimics they need to make a dex save. Thanos “I used the Goo to destroy the Goo” They now take 44 acid damage each if they can’t get the goo off of their goo. BUT THEY MIGHT BE IMMUNE TO ACID DAMAGE.  Ohm uses Toll the Dead for 15 necrotic damage on the Mimic.  Jamison uses his short bow at the Mimic the arrow sinks into the gooey flesh for 7 damage.  The mimic starts absorbing the acid from Mog, NO DAMAGE TO THEM BC THEY’RE BOTH FUCKING IMMUNE, and now it grows legs and it CAN FUCKING WALK. It walks towards Mer and starts reaching tentacles towards her. Mer tries to she if she can blood blend the mimic with her staff still in it, results still unknown.  Horde mimic attacks Bro with its teeth and Bro blocks it with it with his shield.  HM attacks Bro 2 more times and hits with its fleshy tentacle on the second attack for 9 damage and it begins to wrap around him and he is now restrained.  Bro builds up a Chromatic Orb and attacks HM with an Ice Orb, he hits for 17 damage.  Furtim casts Dissonance Whispers at 2nd Level and unfortunately it saves.

Mermista uses Shape Water on HM to try and release Bronson from its gooey grip, it does absolutely nothing. Mogali uses Enlargement on Bronson, and he keeps referring to it as ENGIRTHMENT and it makes everyone uncomfortable. Bronson doubles his size and octuples his weight and he is still grappled. Ohm casts Toll the Dead on the mimic and hits it for 13 damage. With his bonus action he casts Spiritual Weapon and slams it on the Mimic, fire sparks out of the spiritual war hammer, the hammer is stuck inside the Mimic and fire billows out of the hammer killing the mimic. Jam uses his short bow on the HM and follows up with a sneak attack for a MASSIVE 21 damage. The HM starts to swell and then deflates, then this green smoke comes out of it, Caustic Mist Fart. Ohm, Bro, Mer all need a Dex Save. Mer and Bro Fail, we take 27 acid damage and Ohm takes 13 acid damage. Bro whiffs twice. Bro uses action surge and hits with a total of 12 damage with his sword. Furtim ususes Unsettling Words on the HM and misses but follows up with another Dissonant Whispers 2nd Level for 14 physic damage and HM has to flee from Bro, Bro saves his Ath Check and Bro is now free with a massive erection that is 8 times the size of a normal one. Mermista starts to salivate.

Mermista fists MH twice for 12 fisting damage. The mimic moans in pleasure and Mermista takes 4 cringe damage but uses Step of the Wind again and disengages. Mog attacks with his crossbow and CRITS with his 2nd arrow and the HM starts turning a different color. Lil Budgie 3 fails and Air Budgie stayed with Mog. Ohm uses Spirit Weapon but HM screams more and starts to shrink more, it blocks Ohm’s hammer. Jam runs towards HM and “AIR TUMBLES” whatever the fuck that is, and flips straight into the HM bringing down his sword straight into it driving it through its core killing it. It shrieks and opens up, JOHN TAFFER EMERGES!!!!!! Items start to fall from the HM.

Furtim investigates the HM and finds 200 gold, a pair of gloves, and a sketchy blue diamond. Almost everyone is planning to rest, but all of the sudden Jamison just hears a giant something sifting through the sand and so does Furtim, the sand is filling the room and we need to escape. We all run towards the main room and leave the room with the mimics and sand. We all try to heal. Ohm notices in both East and West rooms are both filling with sand, there is still a locked door to the north. We finish our Short Rest. Furtim goes back outside to see if the entire structure is shifting, he doesn’t notice anything. Mermista looks for Mortimer, and sees he is reading everything on the walls as this is his Magnus Opus. Ohm notices another Dwarven saying above the northern door. “I give you life, I’m in your heart, I’m with you always.”

Ohm cuts his finger and drips a couple drops of blood on the ground and the sand blood drops shoot up the door and opens up the doors. As we walk into the next room, the ceilings are higher, there are platforms spread out across the room, but in b/w the platforms is a deep abyss. Mogali whispers into a pebble nearby, Alan, and throws it down the hole, the little firefly spirit falls into the deep and possibly lands in sand while showing very tall pillars. Jamison sees nothing. Ohm does a perception check, he notices a slab on the ground, “He who believes knows the path”. Ohm throws dust to see if there is an invisible path, the wind blows it away. Mermista jumps to one of the platforms. She gets guidance from Ohm, she lands on the pillar. Mer and Bro anchor pitons to the rocksand on each side. SCRATCH THAT PLAN. Mer water bends and creates water and she and Bro use shape water to make an ice bridge across each platform. We all make it across. The new door says “Love, Pain, Joy”. Rufio uses MS PAINT TO WRITE THE ELDER LANGUAGE.

WE REALIZE WE NEED TO MAKE OHM CRY. Jamison reminds Ohm that he no longer has a comp tab at Rocky 4, the single tear drop vibrates and shoots towards the door and opens it up. The new room has 2 giant salt pillars carved at an angle, there are 5 statues in flying duck formation along the walls. Behind them is a platform, stairs lead to it, there is a giant glass enclosure, with galaxies and stars that surrounds a polyhedral structure. Jam asks Morty what this is, his eyes have uncontrolled crying as he mutters “dodecahedron.” Bro wants to grapple him, that NERD!!!!!. FIN

## Session 13

> 2/15/22 *Hidden Power*

Inside the room we see 5 statues, Ohm, Mermista, Furtim all recognize these creatures.  These are statues of the Yuanti, the race of snake people, each one holds a dagger.  The torso of men and heads of snakes.  Morty is only focused on the void of nothingness behind the statues, inside it looks like space and stars, it looks organic and somehow mechanical at the same time, they all still can hear the sound of sand pouring in.  It is the dodecahedron.  Ohm checks the stone history of the statues and learns it is made of sandstone but insanely detailed.  Mermista knows they have a complicated past with the Yuanti.  Morty says they taught the dwarves how to carve the stone here.

Furtim casts Detect Magic on the statues, he notices on the first statue a yellow aura around it, from the school of Transmutation.  Ohm Blesses the Bro, Mer, and Mogali. Furtim tries to stealth through the statues, as he passes one of the pillars starts to glow blue and 3 statues come to life. WE ROLL INITIATIVE.

Bronson just says YOLO and fires a firebolt at the first statue, Y2.  Mogali fires a crossbow at the same statue, Ohm uses Toll the Dead.  Bro’s firebolt hits the lead snake in the face for an explosive 16 damage.  Mog hits him with a bolt for 4 damage. Ohm hits for 15 necrotic damage.  Mermista throws a dart and hits Y2 for 5 damage.  The Yuanti1 reels up and lets out a loud hiss and attacks Furtim.  He CRIT BITES Furtim for 10 damage and 7 poison damage.  The Yuanti swings his scimitar at Fur and hits for 5 damage, Furtim is decimated, barely clinging to life.

Furtim casts Unsettling Words and then withdraws, limping back towards the party. Mortimer sacks up and decides to join us in the fight, he runs towards the Yuanti and pulls out a mechanical device, “I’ve prepared for this”. He casts Eldritch Cannon:Flamethrower, the device starts humming and a huge flame shoots out but Y1 dodges at the last second. Out of Morty’s sleeve comes another device, he squeezes it and a beam of Scorching Ray on Y2 for 8 damage. Y2 fails on 2 attacks against Morty. Bronson sprints towards Y2 and swings his sword for 12 damage. He attacks again and hits for 10 damage. Mermista attacks Y2 with her quarterstaff for 11 damage. She attacks again but the Y2 blocks it. She punches it in the face 8 for damage. She uses Flurry of Blows to and uppercuts that bitch for 4 damage, she tries to push him away but he dodges. Ohm casts Toll the Dead at Y2 for 16 necrotic damage, as soon as it hits him his soul leaves his body and his body just decays, the soul is sucked into Ohm’s shield. Ohm uses Spiritual Weapon against Y1, flames just lick in the air and a giant fire hammer comes down and hits it for 13 damage. Mogali commands Lil budgie to go help Furtim, Air Budgie does the same thing and lands on Fur’s head. Mog casts Cure Wounds on Fur for 8 health. Jamison runs up to Y3 and fails to hit it, Y3 returns and misses three straight attacks. Y1 attacks LB3 with a scimitar for 22 damage and misses on its second attack.

Furtim tries to drink one of his health potions but it did nothing as Bronson was swindled. Furtim hits Y1 with a spell for 22 damage. He then uses Bardic Inspiration on himself. Morty pulls out another device to cast Eldritch Cannon: Force Ballista at Y3 and misses but with his other hand he shoots out Scorching Ray and misses. Bro attacks Y3 twice for a total of 22 damage. Mer attacks Y3 for an insane 30 damage with her 3 attacks. Ohm attacks Y1 again with the S Weapon, the flames start to become XTRA CRACKLY it flies down and then disintegrates Y1. Ohm casts Toll the Dead on Y3 for 11 necrotic damage. Mog tells LB to attack Y3 with his crossbow, he CURVES THE BULLET and goes straight through his neck for the silent kill.
Mogali does an Arcana check on the pillars, as he listens to the spirits, he notices that a blue line comes out of each pillar on the outside of the pillars but not the inside where the statues are, almost like a tripwire. Jam sneaks dead center and does not set off the other 2 statues. Mortimer starts sprinting towards the Dodecahedron. Lil Budgie zips after Morty to try and tackle it, he succeeds and pins him down. Morty begs us to let him go after his life’s dream, we tell him to calm down. Mogali looks into the void and tries to go after the Dodecahedron, as soon as he grabs it, the area behind him turns into space, he is looking into infinity looking through time and space itself. As it is going on this shard of light approaches Mogali, for the first time ever, Mog feels he is able to control his destiny. He gains a Fragment of Possibility. He snaps out of it and grabs the box containing the Dodec. All of a sudden a bunch of mirrors appear and start shattering filling the dungeon with Sand.

Parts of the walls start opening and more and more sand starts pouring out into the temple. As Mogali tries running, Morty tries to grab him but LB won’t let go of him. We all roll for something. Mog tells LB to let Morty go if he calms down.  Morty convinces LB and stars running.  We all run back through the temple, we do an ATH check, and amazingly we make it up to the 2nd floor.  The temple collapses on itself as we stand atop the last part of it unharmed.  We all start yelling at Morty. We want answers, so Mer uses her Detect Thoughts Medallion on Morty, “What do you want to do with this thing?” Three blue eyes glow on her medallion, a blue light shoots out into Morty’s mind, his surface thought is “I can’t believe we got it” deeper in he says “we can sell this to them for anything”, Mer asks him who needs this, as she probes deeper there is a vision of High castles, gray with blue tops, giant archways, the whole thing floats, she recognizes it as the Wizards College. She asks him about the Wizards College.  He knows that we are probing his mind and thinks we’re evil.

He starts freaking out and says “You’re the QUEEN QUESTERS!!!!” he sprints into the desert and a land shark jumps at Mortimer and swallows him and burrows him into the sand, a bunch of other sand sharks come to finish the job. We head home with Ohm and Mog as our Navigators. They roll most excellently and we get home safely without any issues. We head into Mortimer’s shop. We search for a secret door and we find none. Furtim checks the fridge and finds 3 eggs, one rotten, and two mystery drinks, he takes the eggs. Mermista looks for notes, she find one that says” Meet Contact at WC, Avoid AN at all costs.”

We find ourselves back in Batvin we take a long rest. As we’re resting, Jamison strolls through a bar, on her way through, she hears a whistle and it’s the redhead, she asks where we were, Jam tells her to shove it, as Jam tries to leave, three guards surround Jamison. FIN

## Session 14

> 2/22/22 *Strength in Numbers*

Mogali is asleep, a stillness overcomes him, he sees a vision, he’s in a giant meadow with beautiful colorful trees, a babbling brook.  Across the way he sees a figure sitting on a very large stump, it has golden silver hair, robes with pink hue, flowers in the hair, their skin is this aura of bright light, on its face is 3 eyes on one side and 2 on the other.  It is very tall and looks over at Mog and speaks “It's been a very long time, how’ve you been?”  It detects that Mog has picked up something new (dodecahedron).  She stands up 10 ft tall, goes over to Mog, he feels an aura of a smile, “Good seeing you” and then she fades away, Mogali spits as she disappears.

It is morning.  Mog grabs the mayo jar and is going to use it to pour wine.  He orders breakfast. Ohm is already on his 2nd plate of breakfast sausage.  Mermista and Bronson are using Shape Water to brush each other's teeth (Also can be used as a bidet!) Furtim still looks like one of the servants from the Summit, he goes down to eat and play his new Zulcoon, he does OK. We all sit down at Ohm’s table.  Bro asks “Where is Jamison?” Nobody knows, but we assume he’s just drunk somewhere.

Furtim is alone in his room as he starts to shapeshift into Morty, his body turns into a see through gel, he is reborn like a butterfly as his organs and hair and nails are formed and he is now Mortimer. Furtim, Ohm, and Mermista go as a party and try to learn more about what Morty knows. Fur/Morty grabs some pocket eggs before he goes.  Bronson and Mogali stay at the bar and drink and try to find out about Jamison.

It’s early in the morning and the market is bustling, Mog and Bro are still sitting at the table eating.  As Bro sits there he feels some fingers along his neck and back, “Do you mind if I join you?”  Bronson just screams before he even looks up “I’M TAKEN YOU SEA WENCH, BE GONE WENCH!” Unfortunately Mer does not hear his scream even though he meant well.  The figure giggles “Don’t worry” She wears a white top, long brown boots, earrings with pale skin.  (IT'S THAT BITCH THAT KNOWS JAMISON!) (But we don’t know that). She tries to buy us a drink, Bro says “There’s only one woman that can buy me a drink”, Mog drinks from his mayo jug.  She still continues trying to talk to us, “Where are you guys from?” Mog slams his mayo jug down and says “I’VE HAD A LONG NIGHT LADY!!!” She recoils “I meant no offense.”  Mog just tells her “we’ve been doing a bunch of cool Mercenary stuff like selling drugs to kids.”  He rolls deception and CRITS.  She is slightly confused and uncomfortable, but she now believes in Mogali.  Mog asks if she’s selling drugs.  Bro and Mog grab their crossbows and hold them underneath the table thinking “THIS IS OUR TERRITORY, NO ONE SELLS DRUGS TO KIDS BUT US!!!!”  The woman thanks us and finishes her drink and tips the other one over.  Mog sends Air Budgie to follow the redhead. He is trailing the redhead, but she notices, goes under an awning and disappears.

We now follow Mer, Ohm, and Morty (Furtim), in the market. Mermista is doing peachy and looking for a ranged weapon that is light and badass and fashionable. The merchant guides her towards the crossbow aisle. Mer asks her for her opinion, and he recommends a light crossbow. Ohm pats Mer on the back to give her guidance with her haggling. The merchant says it will cost 125 gp. Mer uses her amulet to ask her how much it really costs, she learns nothing. Mer says I got 25 take it or leave it. The merchant respectfully declines. Mer asks to see the manager. A small gnomish man comes out with a long black silky beard, “My name is Salim, how can I help you?” Mer just wants to know if this is the fair price for the crossbow, he mentions that it is a +1 crossbow. Mer blushes and gladly pays the fee after learning how good it is. She also buys a custom case and some bolts for an additional 30 gp.

Ohm asks for their heaviest armor or Stony Tark related armor. He offers to blow the merchant and trade in some old armor. Not happening. Ohm does a perception check on the security of this place, he suddenly realizes every person in the market are elite assassins and that he shouldn’t steal from them. He then asks about their leasing program. We take a break and Pat asks about MAGE MOUTH. He backs out of the deal.

Morty is walking through the town with Mer, and patrol guards and citizens walk by. A couple of the patrolmen recognize Morty, Morty asks about Habet. They tell him that he is inside and they ask about Mer and he says she’s the sole survivor of his latest mission. They let both Mer and Fur into the barracks and they walk towards the door at the end of the hall, and see Habet’s office. Morty knocks on door and Habet lets him in. Mermista stays outside, unseen. He tells him that the crew tried to leave him out to die. Habet thinks he’s by himself and tells him he’s ballsy to come to his office. Morty does a Per Check and gets a dirty 20, and tells Habet that they need to get the power source at the ruins. Habet “Whatever is down there is going to help us with what’s going on with the wizard’s college.” Habet pulls out a bottle of whiskey and tells Morty that he knows what it’s like to have a brush with death. Morty says he is tired of all the failures. He asks for some money to refund his next quest. Habet sighs and writes him a check for 300 gp. Morty thanks him for his time and assures him that whatever they find in the sand runes will be worth it. He leaves the room and as the door closes, Habet sees a glimpse of blue belonging to Mermista.

Mermista rolls for stealth again and fails but sprints away. Habet opens the door and asks Morty if he was with anyone else, he denies it and Habet just shrugs. Mermista uses her amulet to read his mind, he thinks “I know I saw something”. Furtim is talking to a Tiefling chewing gum at the counter, Krista, Morty casually walks up and asks for them to pay for his bank note. The tiefling asks for Tess to honor the check. Krista demands to know who Mer is since she and Morty used to date… AWKWARD. Tess brings Fur/Mor the gold, and people around the room are listening to their drama, invested. Morty just brushes it off and leaves while the coworkers snicker. Furtim gets back to his room and shape shifts to a similar looking figure as a bartender.

Bronson and Mogali are back at the bar, they ask about Jamison and the Redhead Spy. Mogali asks the regular Gre’g about the redhead, he tells him he doesn’t know her. He wants to know more but he is clearly on Dweth. Mog asks where the cool people hang out, he says he doesn’t know about drugs but he can direct us to this underground speakeasy. He tells us to say “Gregorth sent us.” Bronson slides Gre’g a urinal cake with Jamison’s face on it and we ask if he knows where he is. He happens to remember that the redhead is new to town and she was with a couple fellas that were trying to pretend they weren’t with her. He doesn’t know about Jamison. We ask if they were wearing anything that stood out but he can’t recollect. BUT HE DOES DRAW A MAP OF THE SPEAKEASY LOUNGE. Bronson slips him a SeaPlane bottle. Bronson and Mogali go back to the tavern.

Mermista goes back to the tavern to marvel at her latest +1 crossbow purchase. Mog and Bro tell Ohm that if he needs Dweth we know where to find it. We are all back at the RedRoof Tavern. Jacob appears and Mog instantly starts interrogating him, asking him about street urchins, and the redhead. Mog removes the memory of the redhead from Bro and introduces it to Jacob (KID DRUG RING!!). Jacob’s jaw just drops as the distorted memory enters his brain, he tells us that he knows her from the bad district, the older kids tell him not to go there. We ask him where it is, he demands 2 silvers, Mermista dead ass stares him in the eyes, through his soul, while raising her sandal. Jacob says he was just joking as he pees himself.

Jacob hands Mermista a better drawn map of the area. We now see a map of the Cool Drug Alley OR ALLY??????? (THINK ABOUT IT?!?!?!?!) Mogali gives Furtim the Shard of Possiblity, as he’s most likely to die. All of a sudden all of the nothingness of the universe enters Furtim’s soul, he’s prepared for this as he constantly dreams of being an egg. He takes the form of a junkie named Franc. We look at the drug ALLY? And then all of the sudden some funky cyberpunk music comes on. We all get dressed and it’s FUCKING DARNA. Bronson shows up as jacked guy lara croft. Mogali casts prestidigitation and we all look fly as fuck. Furtim tries to play his Zulcoon to get us into the club. At the end are two bodyguards a Tiefling and an Orc. Mermista tries to flirt her way in and ROLLS A DOUBLE 3 in PURE JAMISON STYLE. FIN

## Session 15

> 3/1/22 *Lost and Found*

We are in a place with dancing lights, and muffled club music.  Jamison awakes and is feeling groggy and he has a bag over his head and is tied up to a chair.  The music is turning up and down as if they are doing a sound check.  A voice asks “Are you awake yet?”  Jamison takes a kick in the ribs and takes one damage.  “How bout now?”  Jamison recognizes the voice as the redhead spy that he ran into earlier.  Jamison coughs.  The woman pulls the bag off of Jamison’s head, she is in street clothes trying to blend in with the environment. Jamison demands to know where he is, but she laughs and asks him about the ILC people that he was with.  Jam manages to lie and Red believes he doesn’t know that he was interacting with ILC.  Red and Jam keep arguing and Jam gets punched again and slowly passes out again.

The rest of the party is outside of the club dressed up to the nines, Mermista is looking fly as hell but still can’t flirt her way into the club.  The bouncers ask us who we know, we respond “Gregorth sent us” they start to talk to each other and reluctantly let us into the club. We walk down the stairs, all on the ceiling are all different color glowing lights dancing in patterns.  There’s a bar with 2 bartenders, candles of different colors are floating around the bar. There are a bunch of booths and seating areas, about 20 people are in the area.  Ohm looks back to raised VIP seating with 3 people, 2 security guards and Red.

Mogali grabs Bronson and points out Red, she has two scimitars attached to her back and she is drinking and laughing.  She has not noticed us yet.  Jamison wakes up again and can tell she's been out for a long time and can taste dry blood in his mouth.  Jam uses her psychic powers to reach out to Mogali to ask for help.  Mogali can hear Jam and he tells him that he’s tied up.  Jam tries to look for clues but can’t figure out anything helpful.  Jam tells him to look out for Red, Mog says we have eyes on her.  Jam casts Thaumaturgy to create a commotion so that we can follow Red to Jamison.  Mogali can sense vibrations in the ground coming from a back corner area, Red looks over to her guards and motions for them to check the back room.  Jam gets punched again.

Mermista storms directly at Red and yells “HEY BITCH!”, the guards step in her way and tell her that she can’t go up there.  “DON’T TOUCH ME, I’M GOING TO TALK TO THAT BITCH OR YOU BRING HER HERE!” Red calls down and tells them to let Mer up.  “I HEARD YOU WERE HITTING ON MY MAN!” Red offers her to have a seat next to her.  Mer slaps her hand away from her and finds out her name is “Uma”.  Uma recoils but smiles seductively.  Bronson is watching this all go down and is visibly erect and everyone else is uncomfortable.  Uma pours Mer a drink and tells her that they should forget about Bronson.  Bronson is about to pass out from excitement.  Mer flirts with Uma.

Meanwhile Mog takes out Air Budgie and guides him towards the room that is holding Jamison. Mog tells Furtim and asks Furtim to take off his armor to stealth his way into the room Jamison is locked up in. Furtim transforms into one of the prisoners that was tied up and asks for the package, he easily deceives the guard and the guard goes to the back to check for the package.  Mog sends AB into the room and he sneaks in and AB can see a back area with boxes and a hooded figure tied to a chair.  Mer orders some shots for Uma, they start bonding and Uma tells Mer that she knows all about her and that she has her friend tied up in the back.  She knows all about Mer’s file but now Mer is getting pissed.  Mer communicates to Mog that we’ve been made and that Uma knows all about us.  Uma warns Mermista about Jamison but she insists she trusts the rest of the party.  The guard comes back and tells Furtim he can’t find a package for him.

Mogali uses AB to cast Enlarge on Jamison and he grows to  8x  his weight and Jamison just grows into a giant and crashes down on the ground. WE ALL ROLL INITIATIVE.

Mermista tries to get the guard confronting Furtim to calm down, she fails miserably, Uma grabs a scimitar and Mer forms her quarterstaff.  Mer says that Furtim’s part of her crew, almost blowing his cover, but she CRITS in her deception check.  Bronson screams “HEY RED! JUST GIVE US JAMISON AND WE CAN ALL LEAVE HERE!” A guard steps in his way and Bronson says he’s here for Mermista, the guard doesn’t move.  The club guests mostly start to move away from the conflict but 3 of them stand up and are clearly working for Uma.  Mogali drinks some Spirit Trash Juice and vomits out acid at the crowd (Caustic Brew), they fail and are covered in acid.  Lil Budgie runs up towards Mer and Bro.  Bouncer 1 goes to protect Uma and Bouncer 2 goes towards Mogali.  Furtim disengages and then Casts Enemies Abound on B1 and he now sees everyone as enemies including Uma.  Ohm casts bless on Mer, Bro and Mog.  Uma knocks Mer’s staff away and uses Hide to disappear into the shadows.  Jamison is now free and tries to bust through the door but gets stuck.

Mermista uses her Amulet to Detect Thoughts on Uma even though she can’t see her.  Mer notices Uma is annoyed and about 10 ft behind her,  Mermisa attempts to grapple Uma, SHE SUCCEEDS, SHE GRABS HER BY THE PUSSY, “I thought we were having a good time?”  Bronson cums.  Bronson goes up to Uma and successfully restrains her, HE ALSO GRABS HER BY THE PUSSY.  Bronson treats Uma like a Baby Bjorn and keeps her as a human shield from the crazed bouncer.  The crowd that is covered in acid take 7 damage and they collapse. MOGALI TURNED JAMISON HUGE FOR CALLING HIM FAT. WHO’S THE FATTY NOW?!?!?!  The bad guys from the crowd are spell casters and throw a fire bolt at Mermista but just miss.  Jamison tries to escape and fails, one of the other casters uses Burning Hands on Jamison for 9 damage.  Caster 3 throws a bolt at Bro but misses.  Mogali runs towards the exit of the club and throws up on the rest of the innocent crowd.  Crazed B1 attacks Caster 1 and fucking murders him with a couple of swift stabs to the stomach.  B2 runs over towards Mogali for melting like half of the club.  B2 hits Mog twice for 16 damage, the third dagger just misses.  Furtim turns to B2 and casts Suggestion on him to go help the other bouncer.  B2 fails and his eyes turn black and just runs towards the crazed B1.  Ohm goes up to C3 and CRIT FAILS, with his bonus action he casts Spiritual Weapon. He hits for 4 damage.  Uma tries to escape but Bronson CRITS HIS PUSSY GRAB and will not relent.  Jam goes for C2 and hits for 4 damage and tries to go stealth again and somehow succeeds. FIN (BRONSON STILL HAS BLESS FOR HIS CHROMATIC ORB).

## Session 16

> 3/8/22 *VIP*

We find ourselves back in the club and Mermista is still grappling Uma with Bronson.   She successfully ties up Uma!!! Mermista goes for a COOCH KICK and hits Uma for 4 cooch damage. “That’s for hitting on my man!’ (HAPPY INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY).  Mer walks towards Mogali to assist him. Bronson casts Fire Bolt on Caster 3 and it sets his entire robes on fire and smothers in flames and dies. He attacks B1 with his sword for 8 damage and then holds Uma as a human shield.  Mogali is next and everyone that has been covered in acid vomit takes an additional 6 damage.  6 more club goers are dead. (They were probably criminals).  He T Poses and dodges everyones attacks.  Mogali attacks Bouncer 2 with a spear for 14 damage and attacks a second time for 8 damage.  Lil Budgie dashes towards Mog.  B1 is still cursed and attacks Uma with a Scimitar for 4 damage and misses on his second attack. He then tries to hit Bro but he dodges.  B2 is still under suggestion, he dashes towards his boss Uma.  He has incurred several Opportunity Attacks, Ohm smashes him for 5 damage and Uma smacks him for 8 damage.  He reaches Uma and Bro.  Furtim casts Dissonant Whispers on Uma and tells her that she could’ve avoided this if she was more respectful; it fails but she still takes 5 damage.  Ohm swings his hammer at 2 random club guests, they are both knocked unconscious.  He moves over to the left.  Uma tries to escape but Bronson ain’t budging.  Jamison stealth attacks one of the Casters and one shots him in the brain with a crossbow and then stealths.

Mermista goes towards B2 and hits him with her staff twice for 15 damage, she then punches him for 5 more fist damage.  Bronson goes after B2 and yells “Mermista did all the hard work I’m only succeeding because of her strength and bravery and grace” he then decapitates him. Ohm gets cold cocked by a random guest for 4 damage.  Mog gets attacked but LB saves him.  Furtim gets attacked by a guest for 4 damage.  Mogali swings and cuts 3 of the guests in half.  LB dashes forward. B1 attacks Bro but he casts Shield and blocks all of his attacks.  Bronson calls out to Choncho and Badonkadonk and they can sense him but nothing else.  Furtim casts Eldritch Blast and crit fails, but gives Bardic Inspiration to Ohm.  Ohm uses his flying flaming hammer to dig under ground and uppercut the remaining 2 club guests, killing them.  Ohm then casts Toll the Dead on B1 for 10 damage.  Uma is lying on the ground with Shibari bondage done by Bro and Mer.  Jamison sneak attacks B1 and just misses.

Mermista approaches B1 ACROBATICALLY and hits him twice with her staff for 14 damage to his testicals, and then nut punches him for 6 more damage, she uses Flurry of Blows and misses.  B1 snaps back to reality.  Bronson walks over to him, a flame lights up in his hand, he turns to Mermista, “Would you like these chestnuts blackened or roasted?” he casts firebolt directly on his nuts, 9 fire damage.  Bro uses Action Surge and stabs him “THIS IS FOR CHECKING ME OUT YOU PERV!” and stabs him for another 9 damage, and stabs again screaming “FEMALE POWER, HOW DO YOU LIKE BEING PENETRATED?!” He stabs him up the asshole killing him.

Combat has ended, Uma is still hog tied, and Jamison goes to intimidate her but Uma spits on him.  Jam kicks her for 1 damage.  Mogali goes to the back of the room to look for drugs, he CRITS and discovers hidden away is a small case, he opens it, it drops down like a sack and unfolds, IT’S A BAG OF HOLDING. He also finds five kilos of a pure substance (DWETH).  Jam, Mog, and Mer go to intimidate Uma. Furtim grabs a bagged lunch and leaves.

Mermista smiles and tells Uma that they never finished their conversation about Jamison.  Uma smiles and says “She never told you who she was working for?”  Jam rolls deception.  Uma tells us that Jam works for the Queen, and that we keep working for the ILC. Jam tries to tell her that we didn’t mean to send a signal at The Deep, it’s just what Furtim does.  Jam crits and convinces Furtim to toss some Phoenixes in the air to show that he just does it for fun.  Mer tells her that how the fuck are we supposed to get friendly with the ILC if we don’t get close to them. Uma says we are getting too close to the ILC.  Uma says she only cares about bringing us back to Rothelm not about our quest.  We also discern that Bridgette is still alive from Uma.  Jam casts Detect Thoughts on Uma, he hears “Today of all Days.”  Jam goes deeper and asks what she did to Nessa, but she resists.  Uma pretends not to know what she is talking about.

Mermista uses her amulet to cast Detect Thoughts on Uma after Jam asks what she is doing here, she seems honest in her answer that she’s here for the queen.  Mer tries to dig deeper about Nessa, an image of Nessa bloodied and tied up appears in her head.  Mer digs deeper and sees Nessa getting her tooth kicked out, and a guard says “Take her to the dungeons of the Castle”. She also thinks with a tired laughter “Just a little bit longer.”  Mermista is very alarmed.  Mogali casts Tasha’s Toxic Brew at extra level and melts her down to nothingness.  Furtim transforms into Uma. WE SPRINKLE SOME DWETH ON HER REMAINS JUST TO MAKE SURE NOBODY SUSPECTS US.

We find 90 silver but no escape routes.  Ohm casts Detect Traps but finds nothing.  We can hear the people panicking outside.  An Orc with 2 scimitars gets stabbed with a spear, around the corner we see a Blue/Silver armor, a kingdom guard stands over him, THE KINGDOM IS HERE FIN! (RUFIO IS THE BANANA REPUBLIC) WE LEVEL UP!!!!

## Session 17

> 3/15/22 *No One is Innocent*

Furtim is disguised as Uma but the guard doesn’t recognize him/her, but he successfully deceives the guard. Furtim/Uma asks him if he knows Sigurd.  The guard says they will verify it soon because they are on the way.  Mogali asks where his good friend Bridgette is, he claims they’ve been pen pals for a long time. Instead of rolling deception he just straight attacks and hits for a total of 16 damage. WE ROLL INITIATIVE.

Mermista attacks with her quarterstaff for 7 damage, then fists him for 4 damage and knocks him prone.  Bronson crits and stabs the guard twice for 20 damage.  Jamison sneak attacks with advantage and fails miserably.  He then turns back into stealth.  MOG CRITS with his spear and hits for 21 damage, and double CRIT FAILS.  Lil Budgie can’t help.  It’s the guard’s turn and everyone does a wisdom save, and MOG AND BRO CRIT, the rest are now FRIGHTENED.  The guard stands and uses his glave, it glows red hot, he attacks Mermista, she uses Patient Defense to use the dodge action and she dodges the first attack but gets hit with the second attack, Thunder Smite smashes Mer for 22 damage.  All of the sudden 7 more guards hear the battle going on, they rush towards the fight.  Furtim uses his Eggle Eye goggles and sees a black cross with a dragon around it, with wings around it (CLEARLY A BAD GUY TATTOO).  These are the queen’s Black Guard.  They are trained in the magical ways.  Everyone starts to run away, the guards try to tackle Mogali but he is covered in mayo and slips away.  We start running away.

Mermista sees ILC and Queen’s Guard battling each other in the streets like Gangs of New York.  Mer VAPES to create a giant cloud of FOG.  Bro also VAPES and creates a thin sheet of black ice and then throws a Chromatic Orb at the guard, his bones are exposed and he is screaming bloody murder and he is on death’s door.  Jamison shoots him with his crossbow, through the open ribcage, and then through the skull and he is FINALLY dead.  Jam farts with Thomaturgy and nobody is impressed.

Mogali dashes away trying to find the best exit path for the team. Furtim gathers his eggs and decides on his gender for the day. He launches some more phoenixes into the air. Ohm casts Bless on Jam, Mer, and Bro. Ohm then goes stealth.

4 of the 7 guards start sprinting towards the party but they eat shit and collapse. We head towards the right. Mermista now sees the gay pride parade that is the Queen’s Quest. Mogali keeps runnin. Jam yells at Sig. Sig screams at Jam and says he must answer for his sins, he points towards a knight and they remove their helmet and it’s the Burned Bridgette, AKA HASH BROWN, Bridgette starts power walking towards us. Emmit starts trying to intimidate us. Mog starts chugging his acid vomit bag and he starts bubbling up and spews a 30 ft acid spray at the enemy.

Furtim casts Illusion and casts another Phoenix into the air, Bridgette gets PTSD and stares straight into the sky. Ohm keeps running TANGO AND CASH. Ohm tries to intimidate and fails miserably. A bunch of the Black Guard is starting to try and catch up to us. A bunch of ILC members surround us. Bronson reaches out to his children Choncho and Badonkadonk, he realizes that the ILC is losing this war, they decide to run with him through his psychic powers. The party decides to run away from the city. Mog holds up a blank map to Ohm and tells him to pick a place for us to do a long rest. WE SAVE OUR FRIEND, JAMISON IS NOT OUR FRIEND, WE HOPE HE PERISHES (FUCKING FEMBOY). DIA SMELLS LIKE FARTS THANKS TO OHM.

## Session 18

> 3/22/22 *Remnants*

Jacob is possibly dead, we killed one Black Guard, we met up with Sigurd, Emmit and Bridgette (HASH BROWN). (SARAH MCGOBLIN).

We are on land outside of a town after having tactically retreated.  We are on the shore, Mogali saved us with his swan boat feather, but it was a one time thing.  Jamison tries to disguise the party so we fit in. OUR FEMBOY CAME THROUGH.  We fit in flawlessly.  Mogali disguises himself and succeeds.   We walk towards town and Ohm does a perception check, we are going through the ILC refugee camp, a lot of the guards are much younger than expected, most of the refugees are youth and women.  Mog starts yelling for Jacob, an older woman notices hims, she asks if he’s talking about the little one, “My name is Old Gali”, she says “he was a good boy.” “His older brother died at Helm’s Deep”, last time she saw him was with that gray beast with the tattoos (Emmit).  “I don’t want to be too graphic,... (Ohm does an insight check, CRITS, and realizes she’s trying to spare him that horrors of what happened).  Mog starts crying and goes into a tent looking for stew, he finds a tent with a few cauldrons with watery gruel.  Furtim decides to spice up this stew with some eggs.

	The soup is BOMB now. He finds out the Wizard’s College kicked out the Kingdom from the soup guy, who’s neutral. The town next to Batvn, Satvir, has also been attacked but we passed the city.  The city we arrived in is Khu Mir “Northern Light” (WHAT IS THAT LIKE 5 Os AND 6 Us?) Everyone ran away from the first two towns to Khu Mir because they were being attacked by the Black Guard.

Furtim plays his Zulcoon to heal the refugees, he walks through the camp like the Pied Piper, some are skeptical of him, but others appreciate the change in sound from screaming and crying.   Some people are happy to hear him, HE DID 6 GOOD. RUFIO PEES… WE WAIT

We notice people are formed in cliques.  Furtim puts on his EGGLE EYES to investigate the camp further.  Furtim sees a group of men and women in cloaks that are dark blue, they are talking, he sees a second group inside a tent, there's a War Table.  He sees a third group of ragtags with orcs, tieflings and humans. Mog casts mending all over the camp, fixing their shirts, dolls, and equipment, little do they know that it’s being caused by an army of nasty flies being controlled by Mogali.  He reports back to the party.

Mermista does an investigation check to see who is in charge, a young guy, short build with red hair leaning on a spear appears to be the leader. RUFIO SPILLS A DRINK ALL OVER THE FLOOR THAT PUERTO RICAN CINDERELLA (ISABELLA) SPENT ALL DAY CLEANING. Mogali tries to sneak over to the group of people in cloaks using his Cloak of Elven Kind.  The cloaks, there is a female voice “this means one of 2 things, they are desperate or they found it.” A male voice says  “If they found it we would’ve heard from Mortimer”.  Jam reports back to the group what he heard.

Old Gali is holding on to the source of power we got from the Dwarvish Sand Temple and we know the ILC is looking for it.  Mermista listens into the war room tent, SHE SQUEALS WITH EXCITEMENT, she pretends to be a server, she is pouring waters.  At the head of the table is Habet, he doesn’t recognize her, she sees a map of Ivalice.  She sees red pins around Batvn and Satvir, they represent attacks.  There are lines north of the 2 towns heading towards the water.  They were pushed back by a surprise attack from the Kingdom.  Someone yells “Why now of all time?!” Another voice “I don’t know but we lost 50% of our forces!!!”  “Again I don’t know!”.

Mermista is all about staying with these rebels. She slips back out of the tent and steals a SANDWICH FOR EVERYONE!!! She also reports back to the group.

RUFIO: OOOOOOOPPPPPPPPSSSSS I SPIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEDDDDDDDDDDD AGAIN, BE CAREFUL IT’S SLIPPERY. (RUFIO SPILLS ANOTHER SELTZER)

There are 2 groups left, the ragtag group, and the redhead with the spear.  They approach the redhead with the spear.  Ohm gets a tingle as he checks out his armor.  There are 2 men flanking him and walk over towards us as we check them out.  Mermista can’t act for shit but she uses Shape Water to fake tears as she approaches the redhead.  The redhead tells the guards to leave her alone.  Mermista freezes and literally can’t act, she just spurts out, “Who are you?” “Callor”  She asks him if he has eaten today, he says he hasn’t.  She offers him a stolen sandwich and he starts weeping.  She awkwardly pats him as he cries “There, there”.  She says it looks like he needs to talk to someone. “I just became a Colonel, and now I’m a Lieutenant. We’ve lost so many people”  They came down from the mountain.  She asks what we do now?  Apparently something is happening at the College and we have to get there.

Mermista tells him that she knows a crew of people that are ready to fight and if he needs help she knows who to call.  He asks if she is familiar with the area, she says she is not, he pulls out a small map and shows her where the ILC camps are.  If they can’t get through they’ll have to flee south.  She asks him more, and he mentions the Old Man and the Crone, she mentions Jacob and he instantly starts questioning her intensely about where we last saw him. He tells her that he heard some good people saved him in Rothelm.  She tells him that we were the ones that saved him in Rothelm.  Callor tells her that he never approved of the ILC making Jacob a spy.  They used the young kids as spies AKA THE FREEDOM PUPPIES. She said the people tossed us a piece of his tunic as we were leaving Batvn.  Callor says “WE WILL FIND YOU IN THE MORNING!” Mermista tells him he better remember to eat that sandwich so he gains his strength.

Ohm looks at the ragtag group, they stop yelling and start to whisper as they do a weapons check and they all start to head to bed to prepare for the battle tomorrow.  Ohm tries to search the camp for Full Plate Armor but he finds none.  We have about 2 hours until the action starts.  Mogali gives Jam the Cloak of Elvenkind”, he attunes to it.  Mog smokes some Dweth he gains +1 Charisma, - 1 Intelligence.  Ohm does some too, +1 Dex -1 Cha.

It’s 6 AM and only Furtim notices that something is off with Ohm and Mog.  Ohm notices a small and large column of smoke off in the distance.  Columns of dirt also rise in the distance.  Callor comes up and puts on his breastplate, “Good time of day, stick with me, bring your friends with you.”  Bronson storms up to him as he sees him talking to Mer, Ohm stops him with his extra Dweth speed and calms him down.

We use the TRUE HEROES: CHONCHO AND BADONKADONK to help evacuate some of the refugees.  Lil Budgie also helps with the evacuation efforts.  We make our way to Khu Mir.  We see some large stone structures, a giant wall, with more giant walls behind it. The city is in the center of all of these giant walls. ATTACK ON TITAN.  The gates are open and everyone is being led through, people are being healed at the gates.   A blue haired woman tries to heal Old Gali and he slaps away her hand “I LOST MY GRANDSON, YOUNG JACOB”, she ignores her, it’s been a long day.  Ohm investigates the stone,  some of it is Dwarven inspired architecture. RUFIO FALLS FOR CHAD’S SELTZER TRAP!!!!!

Mog, Jam, and Fur do perception checks, Jam fails miserably.  As they pass through the initial wave of refugees, they see people preparing for battle.  Furtim spies the people in power are moving in a group deeper in the city.  Rufio spares Dia after she rolls 2,2,1.  Ohm does a history check on the city, they fashioned after Dwarven architecture but somehow they improved upon it (OHM WILL NEVER ADMIT THIS).  All the walls are interlocked, he wonders why somebody would build such a strong fortress in the center of a crater.  There is a giant black stone structure, it is a mini city, it is also floating in the air.  IT’S HOGWARTS FIN

## Session 19

> 3/29/22 *Above and Below Part 1*

We are in the city of Khu Mir, we spoke to a group of wizards, they told us they are not sure why the kingdom is being so aggressive, they know Morty might have found something.  There are a lot of people in town preparing for war with their ballistas and trebuchets. Jamison yells FUCK for no reason.  Mer looks for the cloaked wizards, she only finds people wearing emblems.  Jamison sneaks over to the group, she puts on her cloak.

Mogali taken over the notes.
We stalk the cloaked figures with the intention of stealing their badges/info/lives in that order. Want to get to wizard school. It seems no one has spoken directly to them in a min.
My amazing cloak of spiderweb spirits is why Jameson can follow safely.
Mermista gets on the roofs and follows from up top.
Air budgie acting as eye in the sky. So far a fat lotta nothing.
Lots of boarded up buildings. Real bummer.
Ohm feigns ignorance about the empire. Admits to loving goats and being a drunkard. Caves? Refugees headed to caves?
Mogali out.

The wizard's college tried to remain neutral, PAT GETS INSPIRATION for his Castle Pun.  Callor is standing with a couple guards.  Mermista

Mogali in!
Some sort of checkpoint where people are allowed in/under the wizard school. Some folks are pre-approved, some are getting approved. No clue what is needed yet. Supplies are getting through though. I think we should all bury ourselves under food, maybe that guy Ohm talked to? Steal his food?
Ohm proceeds with this plan. Barely tells anyone he's doing it. Tries to sneak under a wagon. It don't go good.
There's Calur! Calur old buddy! We give you a sandwich remember? Please let us in. Pwetty please? Jameson plans to jump out and startle this military dude. Can't go wrong.
Bronson seethes with jealousy.
I initiate master diplomatic relations. As Mermista grandmother he respects the choices I made while raising her, clearly my parenting made her the person she is today and led to him getting that sandwich. That sandwich from earlier has had far reaching effects. Spirits be thanked.
Lots of poor families headed away from the crater/"grounding office". Slava Ukraine.
The only open story is the CobbleScone. We are about to invest heavily in this store and redirect the campaign entirely to it. Fuck the DM and fuck railroading. YOU DON'T CONTROL US RUFIO!.
Gnome runs it. Decent folk. Gives OldGali a strawberry tart and asks what it do.

We have a long talk about femboys and muscle mommies… kinks are accepted here.  Mermista notices black stone pillars.

Secret code to enter office…knock twice.
The interior is carved into the creator, so it's kinda bigger on the inside. Not super impressed honestly. Guess what? Dwarves we're involved in the stonecutting! No way! But they didn't do it all. Ohm admits it's more like a group project with dwarves just one group. Impressive craftsmanship though. Giant archway towards the end of the "hall". Different lingos along the arch. All the same phrase…."one of several, the power here is held"
Lots of individuals wearing deep rich blue garb. Armor or cloaks. In front of the door there is a soft blue light. I promise you it teleports us to wizard school. Stake my life on it.
Sara To'fear. Head of the Grounding office. Shock shock: red headed human female. Probably white too. Not a muscle mommy.
Ohm keeps saying he's Danny Ocean. Not convinced just yet since he keeps eating entire hog legs as we walk around.
In Sara's office. No windows. Black stone walls like the rest of the place. Cut, not carved.
We introduce ourselves as a neutral party…we tell them Morty passed. Things are looking a little real. We also told them Thinfor died. We've met alot of their agents dead, that's crazy right?

Honesty really is the best policy!
We played our card. The school descends.
Sara is a boss bitch. Lots of finger snapping and getting things done.
The empire wizards are getting arrested.
We follow Sara through the school and winding hallways to a hidden room with 2 seats in the center. Each seat has an IOC banner. Right seat has a one armed man. Left chair has a pipe smoking Old Maggie.
It's king Leold\*! He faked his death
What a master strategist! Whoa amazing x10!
He's alive. His beautiful wife has some sort of dastardly plan.
Her plan was sponsoring some sort of "new" magic. War magic. The school was about it for a minute, then it kinda backfired and the school dipped 2 miles up and stopped answering calls.
The war magic got complicated….it was tested at battle of Longwood (where king went missing). An apprentice used the war mgk on northern dwarves.
Dodecahedron is important to keep away from queen. It's sorta the missing piece of perfecting the war magic.
War magic is rune based. Could allow anyone to use magic. Overall bad but from a socialist perspective I'm all for it. Magic for all!
But like, not right now. Damn, Sounds kinda like an elitist excuse now that I'm thinking about it. Changed my own mind. Should def have magic for all.
Anyway, Ohm wracks his brain trying to recall what's up. He rejects Jameson's telepathy.
Jacobs candle went out….
Didn't listen to whatever Jameson asked about. Too emotional. Poor poor Jacob. Oh spirits. Notes about to become way less reliable y'all. Too much grief.
Something about a power source and the dodecahedron. I stopped listening. Lost in my grief. (The dodick will help break down the barrier I guess?)
The college is built on a big Indian burial ground. No one knows what's down there.
Mermista and the king make a deal/promise. She can read his mind but cannot say what she sees.
Bronson mumbling about Eldritch nice cocks. I fear this arcane tomb may be ours as well.
Mermista seems awfully pleased with herself after reading Leoolds mind. Sussy.
Fat magical pressure as we continue down the halls/secret doors/moving walls/rune doors. Last chamber has a little holder for the dodick.
Put on the holder.
The thing is freaking out. Turns pure white. Celestial writing fills the room. The "space I the cube comes out and is in the room real big. Spins fast zooooom. Collapses, shoots out, runes die out again, space back in dodick.
…Stairwell is now spiraling downwards.
What the Fuuuuuuuck. The stones down here are growling. Jameson detected thoughts on the king he also thought "what the fuuuuuck"
…And that's how I knew it would be the best summer ever.
MOGALI STARTS ASKING ABOUT OUR BOY YOUNG JACOB!. HE DEAD! The first wall (ATTAX ON TITAN HAS FALLEN)

## Session 20

> 4/5/22 *Above and Below Part 2*

Dia didn’t pay attention… SURPRISE SURPRISE (intense eye roll).

King Leopold touches one of the crystals (it moans) and moves. We ROLL INITIATIVE. RUFIO FALLS FOR ANOTHER SELTZER TRAP.   The crystal starts to move and shift, a purple eye appears, and a small dragon emerges, 5 small wyrmlings appear in the chamber.

Mogali shouts and moves 30 ft to the right and casts Fairy Fire. King Leo uses Misty Step to safely get away from one of the Wyrmlings. Ohm casts Bless on Bronson, Mermista, Jamison and Mogali. With his bonus action he readies his shield. In the distance one of the Wyrmlings sneaks off and starts blending in with the stones. Jam is stealthed and moves towards Ohm and prepares Dodge. DW3 moves towards us. Mermista moves towards the group and tries to stealth; we do not know if she succeeds. Furtim casts Enemies Abound on DW5 and it fails. DW5 is aware that he tried to influence him and he does not like Instagram, Furtim is in trouble. Furtim then casts Unsettling Words on DW2. DW5 unfurls his wings and takes flight and flies 60 ft towards Furtim and lets out a huge growl. Mog casts his prepared Fairy Fire on DW1 and DW5, DW1 fails and is now glowing. Bro moves and hits DW1 with his crossbow twice for a total of 10 damage.

Mog moves towards DW2 with the budgies and tries to mime that we come in peace, he playfully tosses the lucky gemstone he got from the deceased Jacob towards it. Leo casts Blur on himself and moves up the left side of the chamber. DW1 runs towards Mog and attempts to bite him but misses. DW2 moves in between Mog and Bro. Ohm follows Leo and attempts to use his stonecutting knowledge on DW3, he notices that they give off a certain aura, they are resistant to psychic and force damage. Jam attempts to feed DW2 with gems and food, bows, and then Nat STEALTHS. DW3 goes up to Leo and does a low growl, Leo steps back with his hands up, Ohm notices that Leo hears something. Mermista speaks Draconic, she notices DW2 and 3 are very inquisitive and DW1 is very angry. She uses Shape Water to form dragon wings and tries to imply to DW3 and the other dragons that she is a mother dragon and means no harm. She feels these probing thoughts in her mind that they are suspicious of us. She uses a ki point for Patient Defense. Furtim casts universal speech to communicate with the dragons and tell them that we don’t mean any harm to DW2. Furtim senses from DW2 that they don’t understand why we’ve awaken them. He then casts bardic inspiration on himself. Bronson attempts to dash towards the portal. We all hear from Sarah that the third wall has fallen.

Mog gives the dodecahedron to little budgie to dash to Bronson. All the dragons look at li’l budgie while he is doing this. Mog picks up the lucky stone and tries to offer it to the angry dragon (DW1). Mog gives shiny stones as an offering, but the dragon ignores him. Leopold looks panicked and runs towards Bronson. DW1 and DW2 run towards LB and Bro. Ohm dashes towards Bro. DW4 comes out of nowhere and blocks the path between Bro and the portal. Bro feels in his mind, the mood of the dragon, that he’s very defensive. Jam stealth dashes towards the party near the portal. DW3 sprints towards LB and is just out of reach.
Mogali time!
Mermista making a mad dash to grab the dodecahedron and then run it to the portal/key thing. Mogali insists she should try to run over, very cinematic. Instead decides to run around the dragon. It works I guess but could you imagine? Sick front flip into slam dunk? That'd be rad. C’est la vie. Furtim calls out to DW5 and asks for a ride to help prevent the chaos that is happening above us. He hears in his mind, “Don’t Care, Power Source” and turns back towards the dodick. Fur casts Enemies Abound on DW2 and runs away from him. DW5 is forced to attack (IT BACKFIRES) the neck starts to glow and it unleashes Singularity Breath on another dragon it does 6 damage. Bro walks straight through the dragon blocking his way and uses Shield to block the opportunity attack. He grabs the DoDick from Mer and uses his Action Surge to open up the portal and he walks through the portal.

A blinding light of color appears… “THE COLORS DUKE, THE COLORS”

Mogali coming in hot!
Spirits, I hope he’s alive. Absolute madlad. Honestly, I’m sending Little Budgie through first. Half of all portals end up in the Abyss. Fact.

As the portal opens up, the dragons absolutely lose their shit, wings open up, fangs are bared.  Above Jamison she can hear flapping and then a corpse in blue robes is dropped right next to him.  Mog dashes towards the portal.  DW1 takes flight and flies right near the portal.  Mer does a Str Save and passes and still takes 13 damage.  Ohm summoned the Hammer of Grox as a distraction to try and help Furtim escape; it did 7 damage since the DWs have resistance.  DW4 attacks Mog for 14 damage.  Jam loots the wizard corpse and steals his badge and a scroll and enters the portal.  DW2 attacks another DW and it is concerned.  Mer disengages and enters the portal.  Furtim tries to go stealth and CRIT FAILS, he lands on his Zulcoon and it lets out a sound like an awkward fart noise, the dragons hear it.  Furtim also lands on some of his eggs, (he SCRAMBLES to recover them).

Bronson feels like he is traveling a long distance, he can see way far above him a sliver of light, he sees around him like a cavern of space but he can’t tell how big it is.  He sees in front of him a couple pinkish, purple, gemstones.  (Luckily Bronson does really well with dragons and he is about to become the NEGOTIATOR). FIN

## Session 21

> 4/12/22 *Above and Below Part 2.1*

Bronson does the SUPER HERO LANDING and his ass looks incredible. There is a much larger pink dragon in this chamber, he investigates the mass of stones (dragon), he can tell he is in a very deep sleep.  He also notices on the other side of the room, an entrance with runes on the wall, and it is open, a path leading out. Bro tries to sneak around the dragon, the dragon does not react. Mogali sends Air Budgie to help Furtim, Lil Budgie also assists, Mog pulls out a pet rock and starts shaking it violently, he casts Sanctuary on Furtim.  Mog disengages and moonwalks into the portal.  King Leo uses Misty Step and draws a Short Bow at one of the wyrmlings he CRITS!!! He successfully distracts one of the Wyrmlings.  W3 lets loose a Singularity Breath on King Leo, he takes 19 damage.  Ohm uses his Spirit Weapon to attack W2 and he gets closer to the portal. He does 7 force damage.  W4 fails at trying to dislodge the DoDick.  Jamison telepathically reaches out to Bronson and asks what is happening “BITCH THERE IS A MOTHERFUCKING SLEEPING DRAGON IN FRONT OF US I THINK YOU KNOW THE PROTOCOL!!!!” Jam investigates the room and only notices there is a large snoring pile of rocks.

Jam sneaks around the dragon rocks. Mermista CRITS as she lands on the other side of the portal, SUPER HERO LANDING, she notices natural light coming from somewhere, and there is a large mound of Amethyst Crystals ahead of us. She investigates with advantage and GETS A 3, she notices BIG DARK SCARY ROOM with non snoring rocks.  She rolls stealth and succeeds and moves towards the rock pile. Furtim runs towards the Dodick and goes stealth.

Bronson sees Mermista land through the portal and she doesn’t know what is going on.  Bro looks through the doorway, he feels air and an escape from this hell hole.  Bro tries to whisper to Mer in Elvish but almost Crit Fails, the Dragon starts moving, but still seems slightly asleep. He moves towards the exit and sees runes that he can’t understand, the light is brighter and the air is fresher.  Ohm hears shouts and clangs of metal, a female corpse with blue wizards robes, deep red hair, is dropped right in front of him.  Ohm attacks one of the Wyrvings with his spirit hammer for 13 damage.  He then casts Healing Word on King Leo.  Ohm inches as close as possible to the portal. W1 can smell rotten eggs even though Fur is supposed to be stealth.

Mogali is through the portal, he notices light and another rock pile (NOBODY SEES THE DRAGON), he can slightly tell that Bro is on the other side of the room.  He tries to get Bro’s attention by shouting, Bro signals him to shut the fuck up.  THERE SHE GOES THERE SHE GOES AGAAAIIINNNNNNNNNNN. Jam goes past Bro and explores the hallway behind the dragon, he smells sea water. Mermista gets Inspired by the smell of salty mist.  She dashes towards Bro and Jam,  Bro is freaking out trying to get everyone to be quiet.  Mog has no idea what is going on.  Mer goes into the hallway and doesn’t perceive shit.

Furtim is trying to survive this gangbang of dragons, he jumps through the portal, leaving Ohm to be penetrated consistently.  Bronson notices Mog and Mer (HE SMELLS HER SMELLY WATERY SWEAT).  Bro dashes towards the light and the exit, BRO CRITS HIS PERCEPTION, he feels his boots give way from the hard surface of the cave, to sand with trees and vines all on the outside of the cave.  He hears the crash of the waves, he realizes he has been here before, WE ARE ON THE ISLE OF PORTO PUNETA!!!!!!!!

Mogali walks past the mound of dragon rocks, and notices breathing, he starts to realize it is a dragon, and there is salt water near him. King Leo uses Misty Step to grab the DoDick from the stand he throws it at Ohm, it hits him in the chest, it knocks Ohm back, he finds another body in blue robes drop in front of him, it has the battle axe of Emmit in her back (SUPER STRAIGHT AXE, ALL IT DOES IS SLAY PUSSY). Ohm is through the portal with the DoDick and the portal closes with King Leo left behind. Ohm does a stone cutting check on the chamber, he notices the Amethyst structure breathing in and out, HE CRITS, these are similar structures to the Wyrmlings we just escaped, but much larger. He notices Mog, Jam, Fur, and Mer in the chamber. The Amethyst structure starts to glow, and notices the DoDick.

Ohm walks GINGERLY like he just got yelled at by a lifeguard, the breathing of the dragon stays steady. Furtim prepares some Party Phoenixes to celebrate our victory. The giant dragon awakens as Fur whistles, her giant purple eye opens and looks at Furtim. Ohm, Mog, Mer, and Fur roll initiative. (CHAD IS HAVING A BLAST).

Mogali is first up, the giant wings of the amethyst dragon unfurl, now it is fully awake. (Bro is just playing in the ocean, oblivious to everyone about to die). Mog puts his hands up as if he comes in peace and walks towards the exit. Ohm throws the DoDick to Mermista, he throws it as perfectly as Shane Falco would to a deaf guy to win the division. Ohm heals Mermista for 14 HP. Daddy Purp AKA (Amethyst Dragon) uses Blink to appear behind Fur and blocks the portal, he whispers “I hope you’ve woken me for the right reasons”. DP claws Fur and Crit Fails. EVERYONE IS ABOUT TO DIE. (OTHER THAN BRONSON).

Mermista walks towards Bronson and the beautiful Playa and she prepares the dodge action. Jam leaves for the jungle, beach area. Furtim tries responding to the dragon. Bro hears a crash behind him in the cave, he sees Ohm throwing the DoDick to Mer, and the Dragon is now attacking the party. Mog asks the Drag if he wants anything, they say they don’t require physical needs, Mog CRITS and offers the Drag some Thot Semen. There is a flash in the nonbinary dragon’s eyes, it sees no chromatic colors. Ohm heals Mog for 11 HP and Mog moans “OH YEAH”, everyone is visibly uncomfortable.

Furtim does a Semen Strength check, it is not enough, Furtim discovers the strength of a full grown Thot Dragon, a thick sticky beam covers Furtim in rotten filth, FIN.

## Session 22

> 4/26/22 *Repercussions*

Everyone is thrown from the cave onto the beach, we all do an INT save throw, only Furtim and Bronson pass, they notice that the birds are on the ground and the snakes are trying to fly, something weird is happening. Everyone passes out. We all roll a D6.  Bro feels his muscles are tighter and heavier, Ohm is feeling lighter and weaker, they are a team.  Mermista tries to turn over but she can’t turn to her right,  a stranger appears in white robes, with brown shaggy hair, he has a short silver rod.  Furtim starts to roll over but can’t, Jamison bones feel weird and she smells like eggs. IT’S FREAKY FRIDAY EVERYONE HAS SWITCHED WITH THEIR TEAMMATES. Mogali is the only one of the group that does not get up AB and LB are missing. Bronson (IN Ohm’s body) is freaking out, “Where are my muscles and good looks!?!?!?!”  Everyone is freaking out.  Ohm feels hundreds of years younger in Bronson’s body, he flexes his muscles and looks down in his pants and starts cheering “IT WORKS AND IT’S HUGE!”.  The stranger introducers himself as Timtim Podasky, he thinks we all have head trauma and claims he’s a doctor.  Jam is freaking out that he no longer has horns.  Fur hates his horns.  Mermista is the only one who still remains herself.  Timtim is checking out Mog and it doesn’t look good.

A couple of giant crabs come out of the water and start to approach the body of Mogali since he looks lifeless. Everyone has to use the other character’s ability without looking at their sheet. Ohm as Bro swings his longsword. Mer uses her staff and attacks the wounded crab twice but misses both times. FUNK AS THE DM SPILLS A DRINK, IT’S THE DM CURSE, RUFIO IS VINDICATED!!!!!!!!. Timtim uses Ray of Sickness for 7 damage on the hurt crab. The crab burps and a handful of bones come out of its mouth. Bro as Ohm uses the War Hammer and slams up into his crab nuts and CRITS, his lung falls out and almost falls on Bro (Ohm) but he dies and now Jam (as Fur) goes. Jam uses Vicious Mockery and it’s just really offensive and nobody enjoyed it. Fur does not have Vicious Mockery so Jam’s attack fails. Jam rapes the last crab with his Rapey-eh. Fur (as Jam) goes stealth with his cape, and then shoots just completely fucks up the shot with the short bow. It kills a tiny crab in the distance that had a piece of LB. The crab starts digging into Mog’s shoulder. Mermista hits for 9 damage and then again 7 damage. She uses a Ki point to attack again for another 6 damage. She is able to destroy the crab’s arm that is attacking Mog, the crab is trying to run to the sea.

Bro as Ohm casts Guiding Bolt, he massacres it with 17 damage, Bro was familiar with it because he also knows Guiding Bolt. Mer asks Timtim who the fuck he is, he says he heard a sound, Tim says he hopes there are no dragons nearby because he does not fuck with dragons.

Mer tries to pick up Mog but drops his limp body on his head. Tim as a ritual creates a floating disc and carries Mogali’s body. Mog and LB’s bodies are on the floating disc. Tim is trying to lead us to his workshop to help with Mog and LB. Tim has a cat familiar named Claude. Fur (as Jam) is hiding in the trees. Claude can easily see Fur but nobody else can.

Fur notices something similar to a spider web thread glistening in the sunlight, and he notices more of them around the trees. Tim starts to lead us back to his home base, everything seems normal to us. Tim calls Claude over and has him scout up in the trees, everything seems peachy. We do survival checks and Fur, Ohm, and Bro notice big 3 clawed footprints in the ground and they look pretty fresh. Tim asks Mer about the dragon that she casually mentioned, she denies knowing what he is talking about. Tim notices a bridge that was there when he came towards the group is now destroyed. Fur harrasses Tim from the trees and he doesn’t know who is speaking. Tim floats Mog on the disc to help him cross the bridge. Mer is not giving Tim any information, even though she is from Porto Puneta. Tim walks to the edge of the broken bridge and uses Mold Earth to act as bridge for the first section of the broken bridge. Everyone crosses but Bro feels his heavy boots sink a little bit in the mud.

We do a perception check, we hear a rustling in the leaves from the bottom of the Manglar (Swamp). Mer is ahead of all us and notices something near her in the leaves and just curses “Puneta”. She notices a huge chunk of the unconscious body’s shoulder is missing. Tim moves ahead towards Mer. Fur jumps from the trees and lands on a lily pad and starts thrashing, now there are a bunch of rustling noises.

THE BODY NEAR MER STARTS MOVING, IT IS AS IF IT IS BEING DRAGGED AND DANGLED LIKE ON A FISHING LINE. Bro casts spiritual weapon near the corpse. WE ROLL INITIATIVE. PAT THROWS A DICE AT MABI LIKE A FUCKING MONSTER!!!!!!! WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?!?!?!?!?!

A couple of giant frogs appear and eyes the thrashing Fur (Jam), the tongue latches on to Fur and drags him towards it. Mer double attacks the corpse and hits for 20 FUCKING DAMAGE. She uses her ki point for another 7 damage. Fur is right in front of the giant frog, he tries to swim underneath and attack his “Hopping Legs”, he hits with a sneak attack for 20 SNEAK ATTACK DAMAGE. Bro smashes the corpse with Ohm’s Spiritual Weapon, it’s as if is being used by an Anime Puppet Master, he perceives that the string controlling the body goes straight into the sky but he can’t find the Puppet Master.

Jam dashes and gives Mer Bardic Inspiration, he goes “Any way this is Wonder Wall”. The second frog tries to tongue snatch Mer but misses. The corpse still tries to grab Mer but misses and grabs on to the tree and is gripping it super tightly so much that the bark is being torn off. The corpse gets tugged towards the sky and the roots of the tree start to be torn towards the sky. Ohm tries to use Eldritch Blast, Bro does not have that ability, much to Pat’s chagrin. Timtim casts Summon the Undead on a random corpse floating in the Manglar. Claude notices the string above the corpse attacking us and tries to cling onto it, Claude and the Corpse get YEETED into the sky and nobody can see them.
ṱ̵̮͚̯͎̘͋̌͝ȩ̷̱̄͠ ̵̪̣̗͉̐͊̾̅͝à̴̘̭̾̆͠ẗ̶̥̖̺̲́́̑̀͜ṟ̸͔̭̯̈́̄͆̒͐ä̶͙p̵̢͎̗̺̱̦̋å̴̩̰͉̩̂̅̕͝ṙ̵̼͙̈́̀ȩ̴̮͇̬̳͂͋̽̀
Mer is knocked prone from the tree being pulled out of its roots. Tim’s Zombie tries to help Mermista up

Frog 1 is confused and notices its back legs are all cut up and his prey is no longer there, he leaps at Ohm and misses him barely trying to swallow him. Mer attacks Frog 1 with her crossbow for 6 damage. Fur uses Jam’s shortbow for 16 damage. Bro misses twice. Jam uses Eldritch Blast on Frog 2, his second beam hits for 10 damage. Frog ate zombie!!!! Ohm misses his Chromatic Orb. Timtim casts Toll the Dead on Frog 1 and it deflates and dies from necrotic damage. Tim’s zombie is inside Frog 2’s belly, while inside (Rob), uses Rotting Claw and tears it apart for 15 damage and murders F2.

Timtim starts pulling out a rod and starts preparing some shit. Ohm approaches Bro and asks if he wants to Double Dutch Rudder each other. Bro realizes this is the only opportunity he will get to literally fuck himself and he is intrigued. Tim creates a black cloud and it hits the ground and dissipates and Claude is back on his shoulder!!!! Jam starts interrogating Tim about his ability to raise the dead. Tim starts stuttering and defending himself, somebody mentions necromancy and he gets real nervous. He penguin walks and tries to fuck one of the StepFrog’s corpse’s. “I don’t really raise the dead, it’s the dead that raise me ;)”

We are back in the town of Porto Puneta and things are not normal, the city square is not bustling and things are weird, but Mer is still not saying anything is wrong. Bro notices she is visibly uncomfortable and she is very worried. A stranger appears welcoming us as tourists, he says that it’s been so long since we’ve had tourists. The sketchy tourguide is named Juan Sequiran.

Tim signals his zombie Rob to have an aside. Juan keeps eying Mer because he recognizes her and keeps talking shit about her suspicions while trying to entice the rest of the party. A woman (his wife) comes out and starts beating Juan with a broom and he still tells us to enjoy our visit. Tim goes to the cheap inn in town sneakily.

Ohm tries Spare the Dying on Mog it does nothing. Mer, Ohm, Fur and Jam go to the local bar and only one old fisherman is there. Mer demands to know where the people are. The fisherman (Bark Eep) recognizes Mer and says he never agreed with what they did to her people. Mer gets enraged and intimidates him to demand to know what happened. BE is terrified and utters “Pescador Maligno”.
ṭ̶͖̲͗̈́̓͆̓ě̴̩̩̤͙̏ ̸̛̪͓́́́̚ę̶̲̽̽s̶̲̆͆̕͜c̴̗͕̞̆̿̋̽̈́u̴̩̟̖̇́c̵̢̡̨̮͌͋̐̈̚͝h̵͈̐̑̍o̶̞͘
She freaks out and looks at Bro and we instantly know about the Disney documentary “Luca” and know it’s an old fisherman’s fairy tale.

Timtim hands BE and insignia that allows us free drinks, BE is so scared he just pours us whatever we want. Timtim is trying to find his “Mentor” Ioska, Jam and Mer go with him. Bro and Ohm stay at the bar to cheers to their Double Dutch Rudder. Timtim just puts Mog in a hole and packs up his disc in his pocket and says we’ll get back to him later.

We all go to the worst part of town, we meet Ioska, she has blood on her fingertips, long white gown, and blonde hair, clearly a foreigner, she has a bunch of dead bodies in front of her but they are very well organized. She asks Tim what they are doing here. Tim mentions he met some friends and heard about a supposed dragon. He wants her to help us with our friend Mogali that is in very bad shape. Ioska slaps him a couple times, Tim helps Mog into the surgery room. Mog is in the backroom of a mysterious stranger, the room is eerily clean. Ioska glares at everyone other than Tim, she can tell we are not in our natural bodies. She looks at Mer and can tell something is not right with her even though she’s technically in her own body. She listens to our stories and is scribbling down notes and formulas. “I think I can fix this” (BRONSON MOANS “OH YEAH?”). She only asks that we are in her care.

Jam does an insight check on Ioska, she’s weird but it seems like she means well. We all lay down on tables as she tries to “fix” us. Bro takes off his pants and asks Ioska if we will all have a happy ending. She applies gas to us and Ohm also takes off his pants and winks at Bro and Ioska. Ioska tells Tim to leave and grab bandages. We all do Con Saving Throws, only Ohm notices a halo appear above Ioska, but it is not a Halo, it is a tumor that has arms and we all pass out. FIN. WE ALL LEVEL UP!!!! WHAT A GREAT DM(FINALLY HE’S NOT A DICK)!!!!

## Session 23

> 5/3/22 *A Fishing Trip*

Timtim is napping while Ioska is working on the crew.  Everyone is having weird dreams, there are tons of strings coming from the sky, with hooks, small animals, manikins, and they all get yeeted to the sky.  The sky shimmers as they are pulled up.

Ioska is scrubbing her hands, she tells TT to help wake everyone up carefully, she tells us it will take a while for us to get used to using our limbs again.  TT tries to wake up Furtim, Furtim casts Mage Hand and slaps TT in the face.  Mogali is no longer in the room, everyone that was put under has a scar with stitches on their head.  We all take a LONG REST.

Jamison and Mermista ask what she did with Mogali, she replies that he was a much more difficult case than ours, she tells us that we should not go see him because he is filled with bacterum and that it is not safe for us to visit him with our open wounds.  We sense necromancer magic vibes going on in the room.  Ioska gives us each some vials of unknown “medicine” and tells us to take them if we feel off.  Mer asks how long it will be until Mog is fully recovered, she does not know yet. Ohm does an insight check on her and she means well but there is something she is not telling us.

Timtim casts Water Breathing on himself.  Io tells us that she removed the parts of our brains that contained our personality and put them back into our original bodies.  Jam is NOT HAPPY that she still has part of Furtim inside her.  Mer asks Io what happened to her people, she says she doesn’t pay attention to the local news.  She tells her that an old man once visited her for advice but she did not like what she told him.  He went to a holy place on a cliff, Io tries to recall his name, she reaches for one of her journals, Triggen Wogalo.  Mer recognizes that name as an elder from her clan.  Jam asks what he wanted, he asked to help with the Townspeople, saying they were being more racists than usual to the waterbending tribes.  She offered medical aid to whoever asked.  Triggen asked for magic protection, but she didn’t have spells to help them, only for medical purposes.

We are on the outskirts of town, the bad part of town, where the poorest of the poor are, it’s where pirates would be but the town is strangely empty.  Mer wants to know where the temple is that her Clansmen was visiting.  Ioska says she must rest after doing surgery on us and that she will revisit Mogali later.  She tells TT to come with us and to make sure we take our medication as follows.  Jam tries to intimidate TT into telling us where Mog is, it works, TT is scared but he says we need to listen to Ioska. TT points to this door in the back of the surgery room, it has all of the chains and locks on it and some weird stretchy sheet covering the door, similar to the clothes that Io was wearing.  Jam tries to peek into the room, but the door is locked.  Jam tries to pick the lock with her theive’s tools, she opens the lock.  He is too afraid to open the door in case Io was telling the truth.

Everyone goes to get breakfast. Jameson covers his scar and Mermista’s. Fur is jamming out on his Zulcoon outside. Fur is outside but he is the first to notice a crowd of 15-20 people walking towards him, with pitchforks and torches, very unwelcoming. The rest of us inside hear chanting and a crowd approaching, in Primordial they are blaming us for all of the strange things happening inside the town “Evil Fisherman AKA Pescador Maligno.” He is the boogieman of Porto Puneta who hooks up bad children and people to fishing lines and zips them out of existence. They blame Mermista’s waterbending clan for him. TT motions for Fur to come inside away from the angry crowd. The crowd has buckets of rotten fish that they plan on throwing at us but we go back inside Ioska’s house. TT casts Mold Earth to create a barricade around the door. Bronson asks TT if there is an escape route, there is another door in the surgery room. Ioska wakes up displeased, asking what we have done, she mutters something in her own language. She goes to try to talk to the townspeople, and tells us to leave Mog with her. Ohm threatens her not to harm Mog. She opens up the door and the crowd stops. We try to sneak out of the back door but Ohm fucks up and knocks somethings other, the crowd notices and starts to follow us but Ioska casts this noxious gas in between us and the crowd and tells us to run. We all run away.
We are now at the border of the town and we are free to roam, Fur pocketed some fish guts as we were getting away. A human hand falls out of the pocket of Furtim along with the fish guts. We head to the temple to find her friend. The temple kinda looks like a titty. Mermista remembers the temple to be full of monks practicing their martial arts, but nobody is here now. The temple looks abandoned, Mer is devastated. TT has Claude jump around the temple to scout out the area but he learns nothing. Ohm does a stonecutting check on the temple, he can tell that the temple was cut out with beauty and purpose. Mermista jumps into the water to see if she can find any clues, she notices some robes of her people floating by the rocks. Bronson casts firebolt on a torch, Ohm casts Bless on Bro, Fur, and himself. Mermista climbs back up the cliff and enters the temple, there is a person meditating, it’s Traggin! He has a long bushy beard with seashells and other aquatic life living in it, he is tan AF and has dreadlocks. She sits next to him and meditates with him.

TT is investigating the hand that he found in a box outside the temple. Fur uses his Eggle Eyes to perceive shit, he notices Mermista and Traggin down inside the temple. Trag tells Mer that it has been a long time since he has seen her. She asks what happened to everyone, he says they are all scattered or gone. He sounds sad as he tells Mer that the townspeople attacked them multiple times after blaming them for the villagers disappearing. She asks if he knows what is attacking them. He says the TP are blaming Pescador Maligno and them for harming them because the clan's people weren’t being attacked by PM. He fishes from the cosmos and pulls up anything that gets snagged in his lines. The TP blames the clan for scaring away the tourists. The kids were taken by the other clan members and ran away to survive but Trag doesn’t know what happened to them. He says there may only be 10-12 people left, it happened 4 months ago. Trag says he has never seen PM and that he doesn’t believe in children’s fairy tales, he thinks it’s something else. Maybe it has to do with pirates, but he thinks something bigger is behind it. His job is to protect the temple himself. He thinks some small group of people have started to worship PM. He believes that’s a good place to start to look for clues. Mer suggests to clear their name so that they can rebuild relations with the townspeople. TT looks at the hand he found and notices it could be the work of Ioska with how clean the cut is, he hides it from the rest of the group.

We Hop Skiddly Bop over towards this group of devil worshippers. Bro puts his cloak on before they depart. They are a full day’s distance away, it’s been smooth walking so far. We decide to rest. Furtim casts Tiny Hut and we all rest peacefully except Jam, he stays awake and TT promises to relieve him. Jam crit fails his perception check and he falls asleep. The sun rises and Jam wakes up first and sees our hut is surrounded by dead bodies of Mer’s clan arranged in a circle and they are all attached to fishing lines. There are about 20 dead bodies. Mer is bawling uncontrollably as she is traumatized by the sight. Fur tries to grab a crab that is crawling on one of the dead bodies, HE CRITS, and he is safe.

Bro casts a Firebolt at one of the strings and it breaks. TT uses detect magic and can tell it is abhorrent magic. TT casts Mage Hand and tugs on the body that had its string cut, nothing happens, he tries it on another corpse and it gets yanked towards us by whatever is controlling the string. Bro casts firebolt on 4 more strings and clears a path for us to escape the circle of stringed up corpses. We all hop over the bodies with cut strings and escape. Mermista grabs 2 of the four bodies that are free and sends into the sea as a traditional Water Genashi burial. TT casts Animate the Dead on the other 2 bodies and they stand up and follow TT.

We notice smoke in the distance, people are cooking in the distance, this about where the elder told us the PM worshippers would be. Mer and Bro dive into the sea and swim over there to scout out the area. We see a little fishing village occupied with people cooking but we can’t tell what they are cooking. They are dressed in ragged clothes and look like they’ve lived out near/in the sea for a long time (PIRATES). Most of them are armed with swords or pistols. Furtim shapeshifts into one of the angry villagers he saw with a horn and he has the crab he grabbed resting on his horn and walks towards the pirates. One of the pirates approaches Fur and then runs to ring a bell to alert the others. Bro recognizes their pirate flag, they were really shitty pirates more like bandits that nobody respects in the pirate world. Jam walks up with Fur to tries and persuade the pirates, they all draw their swords and WE ROLL INITIATIVE.

Bro sneaks behind one of the pirates near the water he stabs him in the back and drags him 30 ft deep into the water. Pirate Mob1 attack Jam for 11 crossbow damage. P2 shoots Fur for 4 damage. Mermista sneak attacks the other pirate with her staff near the water and drags him into water killing him. Jam asks if he is hidden after he just got shot by 4 pirates point blank. Jam attacks and neck stabs a pirate several times with her short sword killing him. TT uses his Genashi Zombies to attack the pirates, TT uses Ray of Sickness on the leader and he becomes visibly nauseous. Fur uses Eldritch Blast to attack 2 pirates for a total of 13 damage, killing both of them. Ohm charges directly at one of the pirates, crushing him with a mighty 4 damage, he then casts Spiritual Weapon on another pirate it also gets annihilated.

Out of nowhere a MASSIVE WAVE MOVES TOWARDS THE BEACH, luckily Mer and Bro swim under the wave but it looks as if it is moving slowly being pulled by strings. WHAT THE FUCK. Bro swims under the crest and casts firebolt from the wave and then swims back to safety behind the wave after burning that bitch to a crisp. PM1 attacks Jam again for 4 damage. The pirates are now in clear panic after losing almost all of their crew, they are fleeing but still attacking. Mer swims in close and fires her crossbow and merks him, she fires again but he dodges just in time, she swims back towards Bro and safety. The Captain attacks Jam but luckily it is halved because he is still sick from TT’s attack, she takes 3 damage. TT uses Mold Earth to create difficult terrain for the Captain and his remaining crew. One of the zombies attacks and rips off both of the arms of one of the pirates. Another zombie double attacks the captain for 29 fucking damage. The third zombie just bites a pirate's head off. Fur shoots another Eldritch Blast at 2 of the remaining pirates, they take 1 and 4 damage killing one of them. Ohm casts Spiritual Weapon but misses. Ohm then casts Guardian of Faith, a large Guardian specter appears in hopes of saving us from the wave. THE WAVE MOVES CLOSER.

One of the pirates gets caught by the wave and gets tangled in one of the strings and gets Yeeted towards the sky. Bro swims up again and snipes a pirate with his crossbow. The last pirate other than the captain runs towards the trees, incurring an opportunity attack from Jamison. Jam slices his leg and he bleeds out. Mer pops out from the wave and shoots the Captain in his Achilles Tendon( just like Hostile). Jam grapples the captain. TT opens up a Mobile Portal Hole and tells everyone to run inside, the zombies also grapple the Captain. Jam and the Captain must make a Con Saving throw. Fur dives into the portal. Ohm attacks the captain with his SW for 5 damage, he is very fucked up, Ohm then casts Dispel Magic on the Wave and some of the strings disappear and the wave stops in that section, the wave crashes onto the beach, wiping out the entire fishing village. Every one was in the portal or behind the wave except for TimTim… (WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO TIMTIM, FIND OUT NEXT WEEK) FIN.

## Session 24

> 5/10/22 *Perceptions (No More Cookies)*

Everyone jumps into Tim Tim’s Hole except for TT, Bronson and Mermista.  Bro and Mer are safe in the water behind the tidal wave.  TT uses Mold Earth to create a hole that he can dive into to avoid the wave and the fishing lines, luckily he also cast Breathe Water.  After the wave has crashed and destroyed the fishing village, the magical lines have disappeared.

Mer and Bro search for any info on the enemy or her clan in the wreckage but we found nothing so far.  Tim Tim looks around as well, tons of debris around, he swims back towards land and throws his handkerchief down that releases his portal and everyone is back safely on the beach.  Furtim remarks how massive TT’s hole is.  Ohm casts Prayer of Healing, 2nd Level, on the party and the Cultist Captain, everyone takes 12 HP healing.

Going through all of the leftover debris, Mer and Bro aren’t finding any cultist items or weird things that the elder mentioned.  We find a ledger that was telling the pirates to return to the secret pirate cove Bug City.  There is a mention of a Pirate Storm Queen, Bronson blushes and says he’s never heard of her.  We do find Dwarven Green Moss drugs.

The Captain tries to sneak away to the forest, but we call him out and he slinks back to the party. Mermista interrogates the captain, she calls him out for being a cultist. He denies everything that the elder said, and he says that he was trying to get away from Pescador Maligno. Mer is getting really angry that he is saying that the elder was lying. He is saying that he is working for the Storm Queen and really wants to get out of here. He apologizes to Mer for what happened to her people. He says other pirates were taking villagers but not his crew. They just wanted Dwarven Moss, the good good. He said a slaughter happened while he was at sea, it was a stormy day, there were a few survivors at the temple, the elder wasn’t right in his mind, the elder wouldn’t let the children and parents leave and he killed them all. Then the Storm Queen told the captain to return to Bug City. Jamison does a perception (blowjob) check on the captain, it warms his salty heart. Cap is telling the truth from what we can tell. Mer goes nuts and puts her staff to his throat and casts Detect Thoughts, NO LUBE, he is not lying and he thinks that what he saw was real, but it was during a stormy night so it appeared to be Traggin killing his own people.

Mer demands to know if her other clansmen were involved, Cap says he thinks only the elder was involved. Bro is happy the attention is off of him and his past relations with the Storm Queen. Mer wants to know who the Pescador Maligno is. He says his grandma said the stars are the points of his net. Furtim plays his Zulcoon and casts Detect Magic on the captain and the stars. There are no strings above the Cap, but there is something in his coat pocket giving off a magical vibe. Cap is trying to leave to report back to the SQ. Fur asks what the red rocket in the Cap’s pocket is? He takes it off and begs Bro not to collect his penis, he empty his pockets but tries to still hide the glowing magical item in his pants pocket. We find what he is hiding is a very magical sea whistle. Mer grabs it and he freaks out and tells us to be careful with it. He tells us that the Storm Queen gives each captain one of these but that we don’t need more problems. Furtim casts Identify on the Storm Whistle. As Cap tries to escape he slips and smashes his head into a rock and asks us for help. Ohm patches him up and he is gone. Fur’s Identify reveals that the whistle will reach out to its owner every time it is blown and which direction it came from, but it also can cause a huge tailwind to guide a ship once a day.

Fur also casts Identify on the longsword he found, it is a +1 Longsword, if the blade is fully immersed in water, and you say the code “Water Water Everywhere” it becomes a Water Weird for 10 minutes. It gains a constrict attack, it is invisible in water, and it is water bound, he can only attack to the water that it was created in. He is a large creature.

We create a makeshift boat and use the whistle to blow us back to the Water Temple. TimTim changes Claude into an octopus. Bro blows that whistle… Alyssa (Storm Queen) notices immediately that Bro is blowing this whistle, she recognizes that mouth anywhere. TT turns Claude back into a flying cat. Ohm does a perception check, he notices a storm is brewing, his old crusty dwarven eyes notices that the elder (Triggan) is sitting at the edge of the temple cliff with a fishing pole (THAT BITCH). Furtim plays his Zulcoon during the storm and casts Counter Charm (Feel Good Inc Plays in the Background).

Bronson attunes to his new sword as we approach the coast. The DM eats his enchanted sandwich, WE ALL LEVEL UP, (not really, but that would be kewl). Mer notices more tattered robes around the temple, she sees Triggan fishing but his line isn’t going into the water, maybe 10 ft above the water. TimTIm jumps in the water as we approach the temple and casts Animate Dead on the dead water Genashi bodies floating in the water. Mer and Bro jump into the water to sneak attack the temple along with TT. Meanwhile, Furtim, Ohm and Jamison try to attack from the land. Ohm passes on his stone knowledge to help us climb the cliff with the easiest path, giving us advantage on our athletics check. Bro CRITS his athletics check and pulls up Mermista with him safely. TT fails his check and takes 7 rock fall damage. WE ROLL INITIATIVE.

Jamison goes first and stealths and attacks with her short bow, she hits for 16 damage and uses the Assassinate feat to do a total of 32 damage!!!!!!!! Ohm dashes up the cliff and casts Spiritual Weapon 3rd Level, he hits for 11 Force damage with his Spirit Hammer. Triggan is sitting there with his fishing pole, he pulls it a couple times. Bro targets Triggan’s fishing line with a fire bolt, he hits for 11 damage. Bro then rolls 2 D10s and rolls a 71, it doesn’t break but he notices the ripple at the bottom, ripples just slightly. He then uses War Magic to attack with his sword for 9 damage to Trig. Trig turns completely to water as Bro hits him, Bro uses his Bonus Action to submerge his sword into the water left over, a giant Water Weird appears. TimTim readies the dodge action. Mermista sees the ripple in the air below us off the cliff’s edge, she takes the dodge action. Furtim pulls on the taught fishing line with his Mage Hand, a fearsome yank destroys his Mage Hand with sheer force of the tug.

Jamison stealths behind a pillar. Ohm uses his Spiritual Weapon to attack the fishing line, it goes fully taught, the ripple is getting much bigger. Ohm then blesses Mer, Bro, and Jam. A giant amount of black brackish water shoots up from where the fishing line is coming from, tentacles start appearing from the water. A voice in Primordeal says, it’s Triggan “I Promised him ALL OF THEM”. Bronson immediately casts Protection from Evil and Good on Mermista. Bro’s WW attacks the tentacles appearing from the water, HE CRITS and grapples a bunch of the tentacles. TT casts Ray of Sickness on the other Tentacles for 11 damage. TT’s zombies attack for another 15 damage. A bunch of tentacles shrivel up and get eaten by the zombies. We all do a Con Save, only Mer and Bro pass, everyone else takes 16 poison damage. Mer shoots the grappled tentacles for 7 damage, and hits again for another 9 damage. The tentacles writhe in pain and a massive roar comes from under the water. Furtim shoots some tentacles for 10 damage, a handful of them get ripped apart. Another howl of pain comes from beneath the water. Fur casts Bardic Inspiration on Mermista. Jam stealth attacks the tentacles for 46 MFING DAMAGE!!!!. The roar gets much louder, and a single GIANT TENTACLE comes out with eyes all over it. Jam tries to go stealth. A giant Galleon approaches, (STORM QUEEN). Ohm uses SW to smack one of the eyes on the tentacle for 7 damage. We all roll Con Saves again, Fur, TT, Jam and Bro all mark down 1 doom. Ohm casts Healing Word on Jam for 6 HP.

The Galleon starts bombarding the coast with cannonballs. We all do a Dex Save, Fur, TT and Ohm fail and are knocked prone. Ohm CRIT FAILS and loses his favorite helmet. The eye that burst has turned into teeth. Bro commands his WW to go down to the portal Leroy Jenkins Style. Bro fires FB and misses and shoots with his CrossBow for 5 damage, the tentacle retreats down slightly. His WW comes back through Weapon Bond but it is covered in blackish water and not OK. TT uses Claude to fly down to the portal but since he looks down TT uses a Wis Save and he fails miserably. TT is now at DOOM 2. Claude casts Vampiric Touch and regains 3 HP. TT’s Zombies also fail. Mer CRITS with her crossbow at the Tentacle for 10 damage, and again for another 5 damage. Bronson shits himself proudly. Furtim decides to look down the cliff, wisdom save throw, he rolls a nat 20. He feels pretty cool he looks straight into it: for a second waves sort of crashing into the portal, it is just tentacle upon tentacle and different things moving in there, eyeballs, and flesh in this portal it is gross, etc, and the fishing line is going into the portal. Rocky cliff underneath us. He eldritch blasts it, and it takes 2 damage. Acrobatics check for furtim because he jumps down, rolls a 12. Jam attack the Tendy for 17 sneak attack damage with his bow. He goes into stealth with a sense of dread.

Ohm looked into the portal but he saves his Wis Check. Ohm CRITS his SW for 16 fire damage on the mouth. The galleon unloads another barrage of balls at us. We roll for doom, TT, Jam, and Bro all gain another doom. We all do another Con Save, only Bro passes, everyone else takes 16 poison damage. The galleon hits the tentacle a bunch, and it goes slowly back into the portal, the voice sounds exactly like Triggan. Everyone but Bro does a Dex save, only Fur is falling into the water. Everyone else falls onto rocks. TT, Fur, and Jam are unconscious, Ohm takes 10 damage, Mer just uses Slow Fall and takes no damage. WHO WILL SURVIVE??? CATCH US NEXT WEEK. FIN

## Session 25

> 6/7/22 *Half and Half*

Ohm casts Spare the Dying on TT, Jamison, and Furtim.  Timtim uses Sky Write and points to the sky and writes “Parlay”.  Mermista dashes up the cliff to get up to Bronson as the Storm Queen approaches.  Bronson nervously tells Mer “Yeah… I know this isn’t a great time… but me and the Storm Queen used to be a thing… I’m gonna do what I gotta do to save us, please forgive me.”  TT, Jam and Fur all heal a little bit.  The galleon arrives and the Pirate Queen can be seen with a sinister grin on her face.  “Oh ho ho… look what came to me!”  Mer whispers to Bro, “you were seriously banging that?!”  SQ orders Bro to gather his crew and get them on the ship.  Bro tells the group that we should listen to her.  We all get onto the boat. FIN FUNK’S GUEST DMing.

We hear this strong female voice, curly long black hair, daggers across her body, she has a very long pink scar going down her midriff. Jam and Bro roll a D6. She looks at Bro, and she recognizes him and a wave of emotions come over her face and she just confusedly says “Bronson!?!?” He just awkwardly says “Heeeeyyy”. She grabs a dagger and jumps off the ship and b lines it straight towards Bro. Two of her shipmates grab TT and carry him to the ship. “Bronson it’s been so long”. Bronson just says “Al it’s great to see you”. She blushes “Nobody calls me that” Bro says “I’m not a nobody and smiles”. Mer just pretends she doesn’t know what’s going on. Bro tells her that he’s trying to help his crewmate find out who slaughtered her clan. Mer is staring at Bro fantasizing about his death. SQ takes Bro’s hand and leads him away as she says she’ll take care of his crew. Ioska shows up and gives us and update about Mogali, she is happy that we are alive. She tells us that Mog is much better now, Mog pops out “Oi you fuckin cunts I’m back!” Lil Budgie come sprinting towards Bronson and jumps into his arms. LB is now made up of fishing pole trash. Alyssa (SQ) sees Jamison and excitedly yells his name and runs towards him.

We are back in town. This bitch Alyssa is talking shit about Mer to Jameson. She then attempts to speak to her (the ballssssss). A group of guys are eyeing our group. Ohm disperses drinks to the group. Al is here responding to the whistleblower (Bronson). Al tells Bro that his father (Pirate King) is here and that he is responsible for the massive scar on her body. She tells Bro that he shouldn’t have blown the whistle. She wants Bro to accompany her to see his father so she doesn’t die. Bro always knew he was alive deep down but he is still relieved to have her confirm this. Jam admits that he grew up on the ship with Bro and Al but Bro never paid any attention to him and Al was fond of him like a stray. Al tells Mer that she can help her with her dilemma. Al and her crew leave the bar that we’re at and leave us some coin for rooms.

Other Water Genashi start to return to Puerto Puneta but they are not from Mer’s clan. Mog still has the Dodick and he looks into it and trips balls, he appears inside the dodick and he is inside time itself, and he just suddenly reappears. For him it felt like months but it was only 5 seconds.

We head to the busiest bar on the island, Tortas, and Jam buys us a round of shots. Furtim tries to get in with the band. Ohm tries to see if we’re being watched by anyone. Mog keeps smoking his dweth. Mer is drinking her anger away. Bro thinks his plan for a threesome is going just great. Bro turns to Mer and says “I think you and Al got along great today, I’m so happy for you guys.” Everyone keeps trying to ask Bro about his psycho father but he keeps deflecting. Tim Tim appears out of nowhere and joins the group. Bro does the old Midwestern thigh slap amongst all of this interrogation and says “Wheeeelllppp it’s time to hit the old dusty trail” and goes to bed.

Furtim goes to bed and he dreams that he is floating in the void of space, the tone and pitch of the background music is haunting but he recognizes the tones. A voice just says “you’ve been gone for so long, what happened to you? Come home.” Fur says “There is no home for me anymore.” The air around him is pushing against him, a space entity is trying to change his form but he is resisting. “You’ll come home one day”. When he wakes up it’s the next day and we all wake up. WE ALL TAKE A LONG REST.

We head back towards the ship, a half orc tiefling (Georgie) approaches Ohm, a giant Galleon is near the port, it has ebony and gold and the front is in the shape of a hand. Al sees Jam and welcomes her, Jam demands to her to guarantee the crew’s safety, she makes no promises since the open sea is very unforgiving. We all head towards Bug City WE ALL LEVEL UP FINALLY!!!!!!!!! FIN

## Session 26

> 6/15/22 *Motivations (AKA TURN ME BACK)*

The giant galleon is named Wrath and we are all on it now.  It is now morning, we are all now well rested.  Jamison now has a ring he got from Tim Tim that gives him access to Claude the Cat.  Mogali hates him and vows to bully Claude at every chance.  Claude now has 3 enemies, Air Budgie, Lil Budgie and Mogali.  Mermista searches for food. Bronson is testing out his new cantrips and is just blasting seagulls with Eldritch Blast and Chill Touch.  Ohm is eating breakfast as he watches the crew work very hard.  Both Furtim and Mogali are now both bullying Claude.  Alyssa comes out wondering what the fuck we are doing out here. Al comes up to Bronson asking about the seaworthiness of his crew.  Al makes sure that Jam isn’t hungry.  Bronson summons John Sea from Barge Rescue, he instantly fixes the entire ship and Furtim loses his shit.  Mog takes control of the crows nest and summons one of his souls to help him.  Mermista tells Al that she is kinda micromanaging, part of the crew goes silent.  Al asks Mer is her name is Misty.  Shit’s about to go down.

Jam is trying calm the whole situation down.  Al is reluctant but stares directly at Jam and Bro and tells us it’s our problem now.  Mer says very sarcastically, “Bye Allie!”  Mog does a perception check and tells us that he can see water.  Ohm does a Per check with disadvantage, he notices two ships in the distance.  Alyssa comes running out, “God damn it, it’s Patrick”.  Everyone starts manning their battle stations.  Patrick is a rival pirate that won’t join Al in her quest to take down the pirate king, every now and then he attacks her.  A cannonball barely misses us.  WE ROLL INITIATIVE.

Ohm goes and helps one of the cannoneer squads to GUIDE them towards the enemy.  Bro and Mer also help a cannon squad.  Jam went up to the crow’s nest.  Mog comes down from the nest and orders AB to help another cannon squad. Furtim uses his Eggle Eyes to spot the ships, he casts Enemies Abound to one of the enemy sailors but they’re used to sirens and pass the save.  The two side ships in our crew our Trebble and Knife.  Enemy ship 1 (ES1)  fires 2 cannonballs, one hits Wrath for minimal damage.  ES2 misses twice.  Ohm, Mer, and Bro all have their CS (cannon squads) fire but they all miss.  Trebble fires and hits ES2, Knife holds back.  Mer dives into the water and dashes 110 MOTHERFUCKING FEET towards the enemy ships.  SHE IS THE THORPEDO.  Bro unleashes two Eldritch Blasts and misses, but he then pulls out his crossbow and knocks over the captain’s cup for a whopping 2 damage.

Jam, Mog, and Fur scheme up a plan.  Mog fires his Magic Oar (Majesticon) while Jam rides it and yeets him towards the 2 ES, he tells Jam to cut the ropes of the ES, Jam makes it 50 ft into the clouds and nobody can see them.  Fur hits with 2 Eldritch Blasts for 11 damage to the sails of ES2.  ES2 hits Trebble.  Wrath attacks and hits ES1.  Knife and Trebble both miss.  Ohm casts Guiding Bolt at ES1 for 14 damage. Mer is attached to ES2, she uses Shape Water to dry and get the cannon wicks wet, all of the water comes up and then fails spectacularly.  Bro once again only hits with his crossbow for 7 damage to the ship sails.  Jam rides the magic oar and rides into ES1 and Silver Surfer Sneak Attacks the sails of ES1 with her shortsword, she hits for 24 damage snapping the entire forward sail, now it is dead in the water, she rides the oar back up into the clouds.  Alyssa is impressed with their bat shit crazy plan.  Al just goes along with the plan and moves closer to the enemies. Furtim plays his Zulcoon and casts Polymorph as he yells “They’re going to have one Whale of a good time”, Jam turns into a giant sperm whale.  It falls at insane speed and lands onto ES1 collapsing it in half as the crew is flung from the ship.  ES2 shoots up a white signal, surrendering to us.  Mogali is dabbing this entire time.  The crew of the Wrath is going fucking apeshit… sorry… whaleshit and everyone is happy other than Whale Jamison.  JWhale still has tiefling horns and is slowly getting used to becoming a whale.  Furtim doesn’t want to turn Jam back into his original form.  Mermista is now riding JWhale and they ride towards Furtim, Mermist nut taps Furtim and JWhale is now back to boring old Jamison.

Our ships tie up the remaining enemy ship, everyone on the crew is bowing to us other than one.  He has red hair and is very fit, Georgie introduces Alyssa as she greets Patrick of the Root.  He is very angry and eventually takes a need and yells Parlay, he offers her a carving of his Boat Circle (helm), and the crew goes nuts.  It is a symbol of giving up his pink slips, Mast and Furious. Claude attacks Fur.  Mer goes super catty and tells Al that she never wants to hear her bitch about our crew ever again (THANKS JOHN SEA YOU SAVED US!) Patrick’s crew joined Alyssa’s crew.  Bronson and Patrick give each other the Lieutenant Dan wave as they used trawl shrimp together in another life.  Fur grills Pat about his relation with Al, he tells him that he and Al are not always in agreeance.  Pat admits the whale move was pretty dope.  Ohm does a terrible sperm joke. One weirdo on the ship laughs, Ohm says “Thanks Noob Noob!”.  Mer grills Pat about the Pirate King, everyone gets a little tense.  He glances nervously at Bro, and asks what she wants to know about him.  “He’s ruthless, basically a devil in the water, I’ll pay you all the gold in the world to not tell him that I said that.”  Ohm asks if Bro has a Daddy Whistle. Bronson remains silent, pretending to mess around with the ship.

Patrick explains that when a pirate’s crew is defeated they have two options, they get slaughtered completely, or handover their boat circle emblem.  Alyssa has a sizeable amount of boat circle emblems.  Jam doesn’t trust Pat, Al takes off her harness and hands a knife to Pat instructing him to kill her.  He doesn’t budge, there is a code amongst pirates, he would lose everything if he breaks the code.

The rest of the day occurs, we take a short rest.  The combo of pirate crews are now working together, as is the code.  The name of the ship we acquired is the Root. It is now twilight, in the front a fog starts to roll in.  Alyssa comes out of her cabin and starts to smile, “We’re almost there”, the fog starts to carve out as it shows us a path.  It eventually leads us to a large island covered in jungle and shanties. A wide harbor appears and ships of every kind appear in the harbor, merchant ships, a chinese food ship from Fifth Element appears, Ohm and Bro are delighted.  There are giant walls that separate the shanties from Bug City, the rich part of town that has architectural influences from every race.

As the Wrath approaches with Trebble and Knife, the town kinda stops and watches.  Al is now adorned in a very ornate Captain’s Jacket, all of the ships get out of our way, knowing who is approaching.  The ships dock, and everyone waits for Al to depart first.  Bronson just burst out “God I’ve missed this place.”  Jam uses his disguise kit on Bro SHE CRITS, Bro looks like the old lady from Apocalypto.  Mer goes shopping and Ohm joins, they are super impressed with how clean and technologically advanced the city is.  Mer goes up to people looking at her funny.  One of the guys says “We haven’t seen many people of your kind, sincere apologies.” Mer “Do you want to take a picture?!” He apologizes again as he has no clue what a picture is.
Bro is in total disguise, he sees Al with Georgie and 2 large Orcs. Bro goes up to her and she doesn’t recognize him and he tickles her in that one spot and she is in utter shock.  He asks her what the plan is.  She tells him that she holds the second largest fleet of pirates but she is nowhere near the strength of Bro’s father and he has lost it and going insane.  She wants to convince him that she wants to unite all pirates under one banner.  But she needs Bro and his crew for a favor. Georgie catches up and she says that we need to drink over this.  She leads us to a secluded room in a tavern.  She has a backup plan if negotiations go south.  She has an item that she thinks can defeat the Pirate King (Bro’s Father).  She shows us on a map that there is an island north of Bug Town, there is an artifact that has enough power to defeat PK she believes. Bro asks what island and what artifact she is talking about, she responds with the legend that we’ve all heard in our youth.  Impossible, Bro responds, you’ve actually found it?!?! If my father find’s it then it is all over for all of us, if you know about it then he knows about it.  Somebody blew a Daddy Whistle. Plan A is to negotiate but we don’t have much faith in that plan, plan B is to find this artifact.

Jamison is now in the city, a few crew members have pieced together that he was the whale.  They’re so impressed that they’re not even mad at him killing their crewmates.  Jam goes into town finding out more information about WereWhales… sorry Werewolves (LAME).  She finds a book called Lycan, Where do they Come From? She buys it for 4 silver.  Her postman contact approaches her with a sealed note and she needs to pay him a retainer fee.  He hands her a letter that lets her know that Nessa is still alive.  He hands her a small calling card with a raven and gold trim around.  Inside the envelope is a letter that says “I’m fine, don’t contact me”.  There is also a small recipe for pumpkin pie on the letter.  She does an insight check and realizes that it is a code that reads, “Sorry for the shorts, I’m alive, they’re watching me, never have been better, I won’t die before you do.”  Jam finds Al, Bro, and Georgie at the bar and they’ve wrapped up their convo.

Mogali does some spirit shit as he is want to do.  Furtim goes into a local tavern and plays a song about JWhale the Ship Crusher.  He plays his zulcoon and people are enthralled by his tale of a giant whale crushing a ship.  He holds his cap out for tips, he receives 55 copper pieces.  As time goes on, Alyssa uses her comp tab to cover our rooms and meals.  It is a luxurious hotel with cream colored stone. Ohm tries to get a senior citizen discount not knowing that the rooms are already paid for.  Bro shows up as the old lady and flips the concierge he knows so well a John Wick gold coin and tells him he’ll take his usual room.  The concierge has no idea who this old Aztec woman is and is so confused. (CHONCHO AND BADONKADONK ARE WITH US AND SAFE AND SOUND)!  Mermista makes sure Al can hear her when she demands the biggest room with the biggest sex toys, Old Aztec Bronson just smiles, Al can’t help but laugh.

We get shown to our rooms. Mer and Bro are staying together. There is a knock on the door, it’s Alyssa she tells her to come with her. Mer tells her to fuck off, she says “Well I tried”. Mer casts detect thoughts and she sees a large grotto and Mer gets the feeling of water genasi. Mer follows her. Al pulls out a thin black piece of fabric, and tells her to cover her eyes. As Mer detects her thoughts more, she sees through Al’s eyes, she sees small pockets of Genasi people that are alive in her memory. Al tells her she has to trust her to learn more about her people. Al takes Mer to the edge of town, the path goes from stone, to dirt, to jungle. Mer removes her blindfold, she sees the grotto from her memory, their are various members from her clan and they are wounded, they are too far down to notice them. Al has a pistol, she says if Mer makes a noise she will kill her, and she says that she needs a favor from her, or else. FIN

## Session 27

> 6/28/22 *Deep Water*

We are on top of the grotto, it is hidden from people, there are fellow Water Genasi there.  Al demands that Mermista helps convince Bronson to have a meeting with his father or else she will kill her and her people.  Mer wants to know what the plan is but she sucks at being persuasive.  The pirate king won’t arrive in town for at least a day or two.  Mer is blindfolded again and notices it takes about half an hour to get back to town.  Mer tries using her Medallion of Thoughts on Al, she sees a cave surrounded by a beach, and she gets a sense of dread coming from Al in relation to this location.  Mer tries to dig deeper but Al notices, and tells her that it’s her last warning.

It is now morning, and everyone is beginning to awaken.  Ohm wakes up and completes his morning routine of breakfast meats.  Mogali suits up and tries to take some of the bacon that Ohm is eating.  Furtim comes downstairs with both Zulcoons in hand, he grabs some eggs by hand and stuffs it into his Zulcoons.  Mermista is laying next to Bronson and he’s snoring so she smacks him in the chest awake.  Mer tells Bro everything that happened last night, and she tells him to talk to Alyssa and deal with this shit.  Mermista sneezes and farts at the same time. Bronson is confused and says he’ll talk to Al as he mutters under his breath “Shit”.  Bro says he’ll go alone just so that Mer’s clan remains safe.  Bronson starts thinking about the cave Mer described in Al’s vision, Bro thinks he knows what Al is looking, it’s been a longtime obsession.  Bro is going to look for Al and the rest of the crew is going SHOPPING!!!

A fair skinned man with a black beard approaches, the shopping crew.  He tells them that he is an acquaintance of Jamison. He relays the message that Jam needed to step away to take care some private business.  He disappears into the crowd.

Bronson is pissed that Al is threatening Mermista, he storms towards her quarters and her guards and Georgie.  He demands to speak to Al or else he will let his father know what is being plotted against him, the guards are intimidated and let him through.  Sitting on the edge of the bed is Alyssa, she greets him.  Bro tells her he knows everything that happened last night. Al asks him how much he knows about what’s been going on in the pirate world since he’s been off galavanting with his new girlfriend.  She tells him how offhinged that his father has become since he’s been gone and that he is a threat to the entire pirate kingdom.  She knows that this legendary power that she is looking for could be a game changer and a way to avoid violence with his power.  He knows she is looking for the Deepwater Conch, what everyone thinks is a wivestale.  Bro realizes that the legend says you need a Water Genasi in order reach the relic.  Al knows where the Conch is, but she needs to find it before his father does.

Bro tells her he needs to know everything that she is planning in order for him to go along with it.  She rolls a cigarette with dwarven moss and tobacco.  She grabs her hat and gestures Bro to sit next to her, he does and she lights her joint.  She tells him to look in the drawer to the left, why did she ask him to sit down if he has to stand up again!?!?! RUDE!  He opens the drawer, there is an ornate scroll holder, covered in gold, silver, and blue.  He sees a highly detailed map of this side of the coast.  He notices an island that doesn’t appear on the maps that Bronson is familiar with. SKULL ISLAND.  She tells him that she heard of a Merchant Ship being escorted 3 Kingdom Cruisers, filled with Dark Knights, a couple months back.  She attacked the ships and found this map in the merchant ship, it has the location of Deepwater Cove.  Plan A is to get Bro’s father to step down or to use the Conch. Plan B is we throw down.  Hopefully members of the Pirate King’s crew will join their side when they realize that she has the Conch.

The Pirate King has always wanted Bro to succeed him and to fulfill his legacy, he wasn’t the king when Bro left.  The king cares about nobody on this earth other than Bro.  Bro left because he wanted to lead his own life.  The King has been keeping a tab on everything that he has been doing and has been waiting patiently for him to come back and take the throne, but his patience is running out.  Al explains all of the atrocities that Bro’s dad has done since he’s been gone and Bronson is mortified that it’s gotten this bad.  Bro believes her and says he will go with the plan as long as Mermista is safe.  She says we’ll leave in the afternoon.  She utters the Pirate King’s name, “Alfonso D. Barrassa Seahawk, I’m coming for you”.  She asks for him to stay, he says he better get back to his crew.  She unrobes and is full frontal nude, Bronson leaves and sends in Georgie.

We are back in town with the whole crew, Bro included.  Ohm tries finding some Full Plate Armor sales but he is fucking terrible at shopping.  Mogali tries to help Ohm to look for Plate Armor, the salesman says they don’t have it and they can’t make it.  Jims, the salesman, is smoking a very long pipe, and Mog wants it so he can smoke easier under his mask.  He specifically wants Jims’s pipe.  Mog offers Jims drugs, stories, and good times to get the material he needs to make Full Plate himself.  Jims tells him that he might be able to help him but it will take a while.  Mer finds a really good tattoo shop, she is looking for an Eldritch Claw tattoo, she isn’t very persuasive, he tells her to come back tomorrow.  Furtim finds a rare music shop for music lovers, he meets a saleswoman that recognizes Furtim from playing the Zulcoon earlier.  He is looking for a magical Concertina, she tells him that Mercy’s up the street has some and that she’ll join him.  Fur can’t find what he is looking for.  Bro is looking for a shield, he name drops his father and gets a +1 shield for 150 gold.  Bronson sells the Blue Diamond that we found from the Hoarde Mimic for 2,500 gold.

We return to the hotel. We notice that ⅓ of Al’s crew aren’t prepared, the other ⅔ are preparing for battle. Alyssa comes down, armed to the teeth. She asks if we are ready to go. Fur summons a small phoenix, now we’re ready. Bro informs his crew about everything that’s been going on with his father, the Conch, and Alyssa. We break huddle and get ready. We are walking down towards the piers, we see the Wrath and the Knife. Mog asks Al if they have Dees, she is confused and asks what he may be implying, “DEEZ NUTS”. The whole crew goes nuts. We all board the ship.

Al takes out her Whistle, the sails unfurl, and a massive wind gust propels us. Ohm goes to the cannons and uses his fire forge technique to improve the cannons to +1. Bro smiles as she was questioning his crew earlier. Furtim looks for a safe, he finds a full fledged poker game going on, they’re playing with copper so Fur loses all interest. Mog carves a giant symbol of Polas into the ship, Al loves it as it is big in pirate lore.

We take a short rest and the sun comes up. Ahead of us we only see open waters. Bro notices that Al is anxious, he knows we must be close. All of the sudden we pass through what looks like a shimmer, a massive island without trees appears in front of us and we head towards the cave opening from Al’s memory. Fur fires off three Eldritch Blasts, Al gets pissed and asks what the fuck he is doing. We all follow Al and her guards towards the cave. We arrive on a small beach with a large cave opening. Ohm does a stone check on the cave and realizes it is all made of coral, same with the entire island. Bro does an arcana check on the cave, a waft of energy with a continuous flow hits him, it feels ancient, conjuration magic is being used. Bro informs the group. We let Alyssa lead the way. There are a bunch of biolumenescent lights in the water leading the way. There are a hallway to the left and the right, we head to the right. Ohm goes first and sees another vertical hallway with what appears to be the end of the hallway but he can’t see. Mog takes the left path, we all switch to the left path. We keep following the winding hallways and reach a large open room. The water goes down a bit, and in the center is a massive coral column in the center of the room. The water gets deeper as we get closer to the column. Mog gets into waist high water, he sees a square coral column with 3 seashells, seagreen, deep blue and pink seashell. Ohm detects that there is Illusion Magic being used.

We ask Al if she knows anything about the shells. She says she doesn’t and tries to get us to investigate, but Fur convinces her that she should be the one to fuck with the shells. She picks up the pink shell but nothing happens. She touches the other ones but nothing happens. We try to take the pink shell with us. We can tell that the illusion magic doesn’t follow the shell it remains with the pedestal. We leave the shells there. Fur stays in the room, everyone else goes to the right path. Fur messes with the shells and puts them in a specific order, the pedestal opened up with a water ring inside. Fur takes the ring. He casts Identify on it but it will take 10 minutes.

The rest of the crew goes back down the right path, we see another room with a column. There are specific areas around the column that are way deeper, we can tell that they can suck people in. Mog warns us of where they are. Furtim Identifies the ring as the Ring of Water Walking. He catches up to the rest of us. We head north and find another massive room with 4 columns in it, all of the water is the same color except one area that is murky. There is a table with a conch on it in the center of the room FIN. We all get inspiration!!! Except Jamison

## Session 28

> 7/5/22 *In Arm's Reach*

Jamison arrived on the third ship, Mogali uses his telepathic powers to give him directions to meet us.  We see in front of us a very large room filled with water, there are 4 giant pillars in front of a black altar. Atop the altar is the conch.  The water is mostly knee deep, but Bronson notices there is an area inside the pillars where the water drops down.  Ohm casts Find Traps on the room, but nothing alerts him.

We decide to kind of spread around the pillars.  Furtim puts on his ring and goes over the area where the water begins to drop off, walking on the water.  Fur notices that Alyssa is dead focused on the conch, she kind of snaps out of it but a brief instance of anger appears on her face and only Fur notices.  Mermista swims in the deep water, she can tell it goes down very deep, she feels no movement at all. Mer tries to use her Detect Thoughts medallion, she can tell that there is a presence somewhere in the this room but no thoughts can be detected.  She alerts the crew.  Furtim prepares to use Mage Hand to try and grab the Deepwater Conch safely.

Bro readies an attack.  Alyssa heads towards the conch.  Fur sends out the Mage Hand and as it approaches the altar, a small whirlpool appears, and out comes a humanoid figure with a deep blue bald head, it has blue and purple tentacles on its face, it is covered in a seaweed outfit, 2 deep blue arms, its eyes are pitch black.  “Who goes there?”  Fur keeps trying to sneak his Mage Hand past the creature, but when it grabs onto the conch it won’t budge.  The creature says it’s name is Marketh and he serves the Cave of the Kraken.  Fur claims that he also serves the Cave of the Kraken, he attempts to carve the Kraken symbol on his hand, Mark tells him that if he does serve the Kraken he knows that nobody must be allowed to take the conch.

Mermista tries to reason with Mark since she is of Water Genasi but he tells her that he is bound to protect this place.  Meanwhile, Bro slowly lowers his sword to the water and releases his Water Weird into the water without anyone noticing since they are invisible in water.  Marketh tells Mer to come towards it.  Ohm readies Dispel Magic on Mark.  Mermista walks towards his outstretched arm with a hand, “The people of the waves, we show deep respect for, I wish to see into your heart why you need this item.”  His hand kind of creates an orb of water over her hand and she can feel it probing her thoughts.  Mer thinks really hard about saving her people.  Mer’s memory goes back to her on the edge looking down at her people, Mark is with her in the memory, he then turns and sees Alyssa with a gun pointing at Mer.  Mer can feel Mark getting very angry, they leave the memory and Mark says he’s sorry that he can’t give her the Conch if she is being forced.  Mark knows that Mer is being honest but he can’t trust Al.  All this time, Al and Georgie are sneaking towards the conch.

COWABUNGA IT IS.  Jam goes stealth and approaches the the altar.  Mark’s tentacles start to swell, and he can sense the Water Weird.  Alyssa keeps coming towards the conch.  Everyone heads for the altar,  Mark is changing colors and clearly feels threatened.  Bro sends the WW to flank on the right side, as it crosses Mark, a low grumble can be heard. WE ROLL FOR INITIATIVE.

First up is Georgie, she sprints over and tries to grab the conch, but it won’t move.  Mark’s tentacles move back and we see a mouth with sharp teeth, it yells.  Mog, Mer, Jam, and Fur have to do a Charisma save because they can understand it.  The screams are reverberating off the walls only Fur is affected, he is now Frightened for a minute.  A giant wall of water skyrockets towards the ceiling, blocking our only exit.  Mermista runs towards the conch, her Mobile feat allows her to avoid and Opportunity Attack.  She does a strength check to steal it from Georgie, Georgie fends Mer off.  Mer does an Arcana check, as soon as her hand touches the conch, she can feel a immense sense of power coming from the conch.  It moves when she touches it unlike when Georgie grabbed it.  Mer tries to harness the power from the Conch, she can feel an immense pain take over her body, she is paralyzed by the power.  Mogali runs towards the altar, he casts Sanctuary on Mermista in order to help protect her.  Lil Budgie dashes up next to Mer.  Ohm casts Bless on everyone but Mog.  The water around us starts to churn in certain areas.  3 Water Weirds pop up.  WW1 approaches Georgie and tries to surround her, but she breaks free.  WW2 attacks Georgie twice but dodges both of the attacks.  WW3 also attacks G but misses.  Jamison sneak attacks Mark with a short bow for 10 damage. Jam goes back stealth.  Alyssa yells out in surprise at Georgie and runs over to her and attacks Mark with her rapier and causes a deep gash in his chest.  Fur Michael Jackson touches himself and casts Heroism, temporarily curing his Frightened, he then gives Mer Bardic Inspiration. Bronson swims over to Marketh, casts Hex on him and proceeds to slash his bitch ass twice for a total of 28 damage.  BWW then attacks Mark for 16 bludgeoning damage, and then grapples him, pulling him closer.  G tries to attack Mer but the Sanctuary saves Mer, G then tries to hit the WWs but misses.

Black goo starts to leave Mark’s hand into BWW as it fills black, and the deep area containing water has Giant Black Tentacles come out of the water.  He then tries to attack Bro but misses.  Mer tries to break her paralysis, and SUCCEEDS.  She recollects herself and tries to grab the shell for herself but fails her Arcana check and can’t find the inner strength to move it.  Mer then moves to the other side of the altar, she then uses a Ki point for Patient Defense.  She lets go of the conch.  Mogali takes a blow gun and crushes up a little pixies and shoots it at the evil WWs and G and covers them in Faerie Fire.  LB tries to grab the conch but strength alone will not move it.  Claudio tries to grab the conch and NAT 20s the arcana check but still won’t move the shell.  Ohm runs up to Mark and casts Spiritual Weapon, a giant Spinning Hammer comes down and smashes Marketh’s skull in and he goes limp HE DED!  The Black Tentacles also disappeared!!!!  Ohm then attacks WW2 with a crossbow for 4 damage.  The evil WWs start going nuts when they realize Mark is dead.  WW1 attacks Ohm and and misses him with a constrict.  WW2 attempts the same attack on Ohm dodges again but each times he’s pushed 5 ft back.  WW3 attacks Bro twice but fails both attempts. Jam sneak attacks WW2 for 7 damage and stealths.  Al just disappears as far as we know… sneaky… sneaky.  Furtim uses Eldritch Blast on WW2, one beam hits for 3 force damage, the other hits 8 force damage.  Fur gives Bro Bard Inspiration.  Bro moves his hex to WW2.  He then hacks it twice with his sword, for a total of 20 damage.  FIN!

## Session 29

> 7/12/22 *Bonds*

Georgie starts off our ongoing battle, she goes up to WW1 and strikes twice and misses both attacks.  Mermista is now up, she attacks WW1 with her staff for 3 damage, and then punches it for 7 damage.  She uses a ki point for 2 unarmed strikes for 11 damage.  Mogali runs up to WW2 and swings with his halperd he misses the first time but hits on the second for 13 damage.  Mog tries to blind it, but he fails. He then calls for Lil Budgie to come to him. Ohm moves up to WW2 and swings with his hammer for a total of 11 damage.  WW1 attacks Bronson twice and misses like a bitch.  WW2 attacks Ohm, it hits him for 12 damage.  WW3 goes after Bronson it tries to strike him but he casts Shield and blocks both attacks.  He passes his strength saving throw and is pushed 15 ft back.  Jamison sneak attacks WW1 for 9 sneak attack damage and he goes back stealth.  Alyssa comes out of stealth and goes up behind Georgie and tries to grapple her “What are you doing?!”, Georgie fights her off.  Bronson swims up to WW2 and hacks him twice with his magic sword for 25 damage.  Bro uses his action surge to take another turn and crushes it for 34 damage, it is a shell of its self.  BWW swims over to WW2, it CRITS and just swallows up WW2 with a giant bite and kills it.  Furtim uses Eldritch Blast on WW1 for a total of 16 damage.  Fur moves back behind one of the columns.  Claudio flicks off the DM.

Georgie tries to go after Mermista and attacks her with a blade across her chest with her rapier for 8 damage.  She tries to go stealth, Ohm and BWW can still see her.  Mermista freshly bleeding, delays her turn waiting for Georgie to appear again. Mogali yells for Mer to grab the conch, he attacks WW1 for 8 damage.  He then uses his BA to cast Sanctuary on Mer again.  Ohm goes up to WW1 and hits him with his hammer for 9 damage.  He then uses Spiritual Weapon to hit WW1 for 7 force damage.  WW1 attacks Ohm twice for 27 bludgeoning damage.  WW3 attacks Mog twice for 28 damage, jokes on him he just ate his ass.  Jam sneak attacks WW1 for 10 damage and goes stealth again.  Alyssa dashes past Mermista and sees her try to restrain Georgie again, but once again G fights it away but now she is no longer stealth.  Bro has his BWW swim up to G and attack but she parries the attack.  Bro goes up to WW1 and does a vertical slice up the middle, it just explodes into Anime Rain and falls down upon us all.  Bro then attacks WW3 for 12 damage.  Mermista now uses her turn to grab the conch, she uses Bardic Inspiration for a total of 18, but Mog uses Flash of Genius to give her an extra 3 point boost.  She grabs it and she feels an arcane tether on the conch, it snaps and she is now holding the Deepwater Conch in her hands.  She uses a ki point for Step of the Wind and dashes 110 ft away towards Furtim, he is playing the zulcoon as she approaches.  Furtim grabs her and hugs her and opens up a Dimension Door and yeets them both straight upward into the sky.  They end up 340 ft in the air and are 40 ft above the coral, Fur screams “MY EGGS” as his eggs fly out of his pocket and he takes 19 fall damage, Mer gracefully uses Slow Fall to take no damage.  Fur stands up a little fucked up.

WE ALL DO A PERCEPTION CHECK, Georgie sees Fur and Mer poof out and screams out a deep and gutteral NOOOOOOOOO! She tries to stealth and fails and starts sprinting towards the exit being blocked by water, she incurs an OA from BWW he hits her but she uses parry and avoids damage.  WW3 dissipates the second that the conch disappears and the second G sprints away SUS.  Mer is standing atop the coral cave she notices smoke and 4 ships, she recognizes one of the ships, the other ship that we arrived on is just a floating pile of debris.

Combat is over, Jamison screams at Alyssa “What the fuck is wrong with Georgie?!” Alyssa is visabally confused and shooketh.  Mog send LB towards G, and then shoots at G with a crossbow for 3 damage.  Ohm moves towards the exit.  Jam shoots at G and misses.  Al calls out to G and dashes over to her.  Bro dashes over to the wall of water and uses Shape Water to carve out a hole in the wall, it changes the flow of water inwards and Bro can’t get through the passageway, he then closes the opening.  Mermista tries to study the conch some more but she clearly needs more time. Mer attempts to climb down the back of the cave away from the ships, she nimbly moves down.  Everyone inside the cave sees G look across the room at Al and takes a running charge at the wall of water, she breaks through while being pushed up but still gets through.  The cave now starts filling with water.  Ohm uses his Spiritual Thor Hammer to yeet him through the water wall.  The rest of the crew storm through the water wall, including Alyssa, Bro’s WW grabs Jam and yeets her through wall.  Al is crying and clearly furious.  Ohm casts Healing Word on himself for 9 HP.

Bro does a history check, he notices the water rising, the biolumenence starts leaving the cave towards the exit.  As it gets darker in this cave, the only light is sunlight coming from the entrance.  We notice fire and parts of the ships that we arrived on just strewed all over the water.  Wrath is still there but our other ship is decimated.  We see some massive ships surrounding Wrath, Georgie is on the beach surrounded by Orcs and other Pirates clad in all black.  Al screams at G saying “WHAT THE FUCK”.  Bronson knows exactly who this is, he feels an ice cold feeling up his spine as he recognizes the flag of the main ship.  He hears a deep laugh that is so familiar to him, he is laughing at Alyssa.  A giant man with scars all over his face and neck looks down on everyone, he towers over everyone else.  “It’s good to see you boy!” It’s Alfonso.  He grabs Georgie by the neck and says “Welcome to the crew” as he is staring at Alyssa.  He rips out one of the earrings of Georgie as that was what he was using to communicate with her the entire time.  30 people of Alfonso’s come in row boats and surround our crew.

Mogali just slaps Bronson on the back and says “Boy Bronson is this the old man that you’ve told me so much about! Pleasure to meet you sir!”  Alfonso spreads his arms and tries to welcome Bronson into his arms.  Bronson embraces him and says “Welcome father it’s been too long.” Alyssa looks utterly defeated.  Alfonso is so happy to have Bro back and whispers “It’s been far too long.”  Alf adeptly and swiftly moves over to Alyssa and grabs her by the throat and also whispers “it’s been too long” as strengthens his grip.  Jam is furious and tries to intervene.  Bronson screams at Jam “THIS IS A 2 HARLEY SITUATION STAND THE FUCK DOWN!” Jam knows Bro is speaking in code and he stands down.  Alf screams at Al “WHERE IS IT”, she tries to deceive him but he is dragging Al by her hair and says that he’ll figure this out later.  He tells Bro to come on the ship, and Georgie and the crew minus Fur and Mer board the ship.  Fur tells Mer that the safety word is eagles.  Mer continues climbing down the coral cave.  Fur shapeshifts into Georgie and fires 2 Eldritch Blasts at the sails of Alf’s ships and then some of Alf’s pirates start heading towards him.  Mermista swims down deep into the water, Air Budgie communicates to Mer and tells her to attach her self to one of Alf’s boats.  Fur (As Georgie) tells Alf’s crew that one of Bro’s crew swam away with the conch and he points in the opposite direction.  Alf’s crew is super confused as they just saw G down on the ship.  2 of them try to restrain Fur as the others try and go to where he is pointing.  Fur casts Suggestion on the 2 trying to restrain him, the orc slaps Fur and starts marching Fur to the bottom of the hill.  Fur is dragged down to Alfonso Seahawk, as the real Georgie is standing right next to him.  We all board the main galley, as Mermista attaches herself to Wrath.

## Session 30

> 8/16/22 *Atonement*

We are all hungover from doing our Dweth one shot and we awaken in the room with Georgie watching over us.  Mermista is still hiding underneath the Wrath.  One of the guards comes in and asks “Are you guys high?” Mogali responds, “It was either this or plan an escape!” We are still mumbling about our opinions on Israel.  For our one shot we got a Brace of Daggers, a Wand of Magic Missiles (but it shoots out scary clowns), a cracked Mirror of the Past, All Purpose Tool plus 1, Ring of the Spells (Clown nose) and an Abra Cadabrus.

Mogali asks Georgie, “WHY!?!?”.  She responds that she has her reasons.  She said her brother fell in with Alfonso’s crew a long time ago, she said he was threatened and so she had to obey.  Jamison is in utter disbelief, “I thought we were your family?”.   Mog tells G that he needs to use the poop deck, she kicks over a bucket and tells him to use this.  Mermista is being dragged by the ship, she uses a dagger to stay attached to the ship. We hear a knock on the door, 3 of Alf’s crew wants to see us above.  FURTIM’S EGG FINGER FEELS TOTALLY NUMB!!! We go above deck to speak to Alfonso.  We our on the main ship, it’s dusk.  Alf’s crew is all around the ship and all eyes are on us.  To the right of Alf is Alyssa in shackles.  He goes to embrace Bronson “MY SON!”.  Bronson asks “Are we going to have a catch?”  Everyone is confused. Bronson sees a bunch of members he grew up with and even more crew members that were former captains of their own ships that now follow Alf.  Bro informs his dad that his crew member needs to poop and if we’re going to work together his crew poops when they want to.  3 of Alf’s crew lead Mog to a bathroom.  Alf keeps looking at Furtim disguised as Georgie, real G been wearing a magical earring that allowed her to communicate with Alf the whole time.  Alf tells Bro to get his crew together.  Bro tells Fur to turn back into himself.
Alf is getting angry and demands to know where the conch is, Bro says that he knows that they’ve searched us and we only have eggs and good times on us. Alf believes him and then punches Jam in the face.  Alf tells Bro that he knows one of his crew must know what it is because they now belong to him.  Jam tries to buck up but fails on his intimidation check,  and Bro tells him to stand down. Mogali is using the Abra Cadabrus to make a bunch of oil flasks and starts shoving them down the poop chute.  Mog starts a fire but they have a crew dedicated to putting out fires and shut it down instantly.  Alf puts his scimitar up to Al’s throat and tells us to cooperate.  Jam is getting very upset. Al is screaming in pain and admits that we have the Conch.   Bro tells his dad that we have it but it is our collateral and that it is in a safe space. He drops the blade from Al’s throat and tells Bro that he better let him know where it is when we arrive.  We are led back to the windowless room with 3 guards.

Mermista is under the boat as we prepare to dock, she stays hidden and approaches the docks and covers her face as everyone is distracted. We hear a knock on the door and we go above deck, the moon is full and we are unloading. (THE DM IS DISTRACTED BY MEATBALLS). We all notice Mermista in the distance but nobody else notices. We are at the famous Bug City once again. We are being marched down the streets with Alf’s crew. We are being led to a large Bierhall. There is a giant main table in the room reserved for Alf’s crew. Mer sneaks into the bar to keep an eye on us. Bro sits next to his dad and Al at the head of the table, Al is still in chains. Jam tries to telepathically tell Mer to meet her in the bathroom. The guard looks at his watch and tells him he can go once we are all settled. Bro slaps the thighs of his dad and Al and says “Ahhh just like old times!” Nobody finds it humorous.

Alfonso claps and the room goes silent and he praises his son being back and the glory of his crew. Ohm is already sipping his ale and didn’t know we were supposed to wait. All of the sudden a bunch of Al’s crew is brought inside in chains with their heads down. Alf gives them the order “Crew or Death?” The first crewmate chooses death, as does the second, they have their throats are slit. Al has tears streaming down her face. The third crewmember chooses Crew and he is untied. This goes on for a while, 4 of them chose crew and the rest chose death. Jam is led to the bathroom with 3 guards, he gets upset that he can’t go alone and decides to piss on the table in front of the king of pirates and instantly gets dragged into the crowd for his audacity and takes 3 damage.

Alyssa is now dragged down to wear her crew was murdered and tells Georgie that she has to kill her. Georgie stands behind her with a dagger. Bro says “Enough!” He convinces his dad to allow him to kill his greatest nemesis (Tonfir 2 Barrell) in exchange for sparing Al and letting her work under him. Al is sobbing knowing that Bro has to work under his father once again. Jam telepathically tells Al that we have a plan. She is offered crew or death, she chooses Crew and is taken away. Alf says “NOW WE FEAST MY SON IS BACK!” Mer smartly sneaks out of the bar and goes back into the city.

Jamison is still being watched by guards while he has a giant smug smile on his face for pulling his dick out. Mer is going as far away from this party as possible. Fur jumps up on stage and tries to play his Zulcoon. The crew is taken back to a hotel being heavily watched. Bro is with his father, meeting some of his crew. Bro and Alf step outside and start smoking a pipe and reminisce. Bro pulls out a ball and tells his father that it’s been a long time since they’ve had a catch. Alf just looks like his son is a fucking moron and just twists his nipple as that is their thing (TOTALLY REAL THING). A crewmate comes out with a flask and they share a drink and tells Bro that he loves him with all of his being but if he finds out we are lying about the conch he will not hesitate to kill Alyssa and all of Bro’s crew.

Mer finds herself at a random inn and buys herself a dirty room for 3 gold. She attunes to the Conch and envisions herself deep in the water with a bunch of lights surrounding her. She realizes all of the lights belong to tentacles and at the center is a giant eyeball, she is face to face with the spirit of the Kraken. She starts talking to it and asks for its help to save her people. She asks again in Primordial and it blinks at her, signaling that it kinda understands her. She tries to learn about its power. It gurgles as it tells her that he always is looking for a deal. She offers him up Alfonso to take as his own. “Is he strong?” “He’s the most powerful pirate in the world.” The Kraken extends his tentacle as a hand and agrees to the deal.

The rest of the crew is in a nice hotel being watched heavily by guards. Bro is in the Master’s suite with 2 concierge’s attending him. Mogali goes in and challenges some of Alf’s crew to Death Dice for 1,000 gold he loses a third of our collective gold.

## Session 31

> 8/30/22 *Handshakes*

Jamison pushes his dick pack in. Mogali, Jam, Ohm and Furtim are in their own rooms being watched by 6 concierges.  They wake up and Jamison is trying to sneak away from Alfonso’s crew and study at the library.  Mog gives Jam a magic oar than can be used as a flying broom stick.  Jam pulls out his disguise kit (not his dick, THANK GOD).  Jam makes himself look older and gives him himself an afro to hide his horns.  He looks like Lenny Crabitz, he flies out to the library in disguise.  Jam flies out and doesn’t notice shit.  Ohm is chilling.  Mog and Ohm head towards the library not in disguise, just straight walk out.

Bronson is in his giant suite, he thinks he’s on the same floor as his crew.  Bronson got a Long Rest +1 because he slept in satin sheets and extravagance.  He is fully refreshed and he picks at the beautiful spread the was prepared for him while he was resting his weary head.  Bro leaves the room and notices a half orc and human standing guard by his door, they greet him.  Bro asks about the whereabouts of his crew and his dad.  Alf is on his ship and the crew are down the hall.  It’s 8 AM and Bro walks down the hall to find the crew.

Mermista is in her tiny room, she has not slept, she remembers talking to the Kraken God, she still has 1 level of Exhaustion.  She packs up in her disguise tucking away the Conch into her cape.  She notices, as she leaves the shitty inn, a large individual flying in the skies in disguise.   Mer decides to follow it.

Jam is now realizing he doesn’t know where the library is and lands in a random alley.  He notices 2 teens just staring in awe as he lands.  Jam tells them if they show him where the library is and help him out, he’ll give them the magic oar.  They lead Jam to the library.

Bronson is outside of their door with the guards and the guards knock on their door. Mog wants to go to the library but the guards were told to keep them inside but Bro says the library has the best Nat Geo and Highlight selection. The guards tell them to wait for Alfonso and they’re asking where the dick guy is. Mog knocks on Jam’s door and pretends that the door is locked. Georgie sprints in with an Orc that smashes in Jam’s door and they freak out since he is no longer there. Every one feints surprise, Mog tells them that she stole his magic oar. We are now being escorted by all of the guards to the main dining area. The crew members that won 1,000 gold from Mog wave at him and smile. We are sat at the tables surrounding them main table with Alf and Alyssa at the head of the table as her hand are tied. Georgie whispers in Alf’s ears, he remains emotionless. Alf asks where the missing crew mate is. Mog instantly tells Alf that he gave Jam a bunch of drugs and he stole his magic broom and flew away “What are you going to do?” Why do you think he pulled his dick out? He was high as fuck. Alf pulls out a dagger and grabs Alyssa’s hand and asks Mog to point him in the direction that he went. Mog says he’s a drug addict, I don’t know maybe the library. He successfully deceives him and Alf slams down the knife perfectly between Al’s hands into the rope. Alf goes “Bronson” he replies “Yes Papa?” Alf tells him he is responsible for his crew’s actions. Geo whispers into Alf’s ear again. Mog tells her to eat his ass, she flicks him off. Alf tells Bro to go find his crewmate, everyone but Lil Budgie and Ohm leave, they stay as collateral.

Jam asks more about the teens and asks about the ongoings of pirates and Alfonso. He says that he has been here for about a year. He asks who are some of the worst pirates are, he mentions Zadira and Tonfir, but Jam doesn’t recognize Zadira’s name but he knows Tonfir is infamous. Mermista does an investigation check but crit fails as she was staring at the sun for too long and she’s so exhausted. Jam notices Mer’s haggard looking ass in the distance but chooses to ignore her. Jam arrives at the ornate library and goes in. The crew is being followed by guards, the guards tell us that they’ll go drink and we have to be back in a few hours or Ohm and LB will be slaughtered, we agree to this deal. We all head to the library. We notice a kid flying in the air out of control and crashes into the water. Mer tries to stealthily hand over the Conch to Mog to put in his Bag of Holding, not the smoothest attempt, but it went unnoticed. We are in the library and notice Jam dressed as Lenny. Mer tries to send us a signal that she’s there by cawing, an elf librarian stands up and hushes her.

Bro fills Mer about what’s been going on and she tells us about her meeting with the Kraken God. Jam asks Bro what he knows about Zadira. Bro if familiar with her, she came up at the same time (The Worst Generation as they’re known), she is very rude, she comes from rich merchant pirates, she is spoiled and thinks lesser of everyone. Because her parents were merchants she’s well funded and attacks other merchants. Jam now starts to remember rumors of a pirate similar to her from different stories told by traveling pirates and his bars. We ask Mer for info about the Kraken God and we all start to do research in the library to learn more about it.

Ohm is back at the inn at the bar, he starts talking to the bartender and he starts outdrinking everyone at the bar, everyone is impressed/horrified at the same time as he is just sloppily drinking so much ale. Ohm tries to learn more about their obsession with the Conch, Alf tells him he wants to unite all pirates under one flag and that the Conch is very powerful without giving him too many details. Alf asks him why he follows his son, Ohm goes “Alf, Alf, I’m trying to tell you about fucking my wife. Why are you trying to get all personal?” Ohm tries to ask Alf about Amad Noke the man that killed his people by testing magic on them. Alf whispers to one of his crew and tells Ohm he’ll ask around. Alf asks Ohm for his help in convincing Bro to come back to the family business.

Mogali finds the book we need to learn more about the Kraken he yells “Hey Guys!”, the Elfbrarian stares into his soul. We find the book called “What to do if You Make a Deal with an Evil Kraken God”. We learn that the old gods were at war and trapped the super evil Kraken God into a conch. A cult worshipping the Kraken formed and were set on freeing it from the conch. The water Genashi were key in locking up the Kraken with help from the Gods. Water Genashi can control the conch, so they were banished for potentially being too strong. Somebody created a map detailing the location, and Alyssa found said map. The name of the Kraken is Vrirri. There are 4 primordial gods, the fire one was Gambrorh, a magma tentacle. Himbril, the great boar the land god, and Cxaocna, the god 6 winged eagle, and Vrirri. We look more into the cult and find that the primordial beings couldn’t be defeated so they were trapped. Cx is the god of wisdom, Himbril is strength, Gam is Constitution, Vr is Charisma/Deception. One of the reason that they trapped Vr is because he would charm the gods and lure them to the ocean to drown them.

It’s later in the night, Alf tells Ohm that he found out the location of Amad and he will share it once Bro joins and once he gets the Conch back. Ohm tries to tell Alf that he’ll have a much better chance of persuading Bro if he has full plate. Alf tells him that he’ll see what he can do.

The Elfbrarian comes to tell everyone that it’s time to leave, Mog tells that old elf hag to shut up. She briefly casts Silence and Deafen on him and tells him to leave. He sprints over to the book to see what would happen if he blew the Conch, but the Elfbrarian grabs him right before he reads the important part. We all leave and head back and Jam uses his disguise kit on Mer and she looks completely different, like a typical whore. We’re back at the meeting place with the guards. Jam is with us and has a bag of dweth on him. Mer is with us and the guards ask who she is. We tell them we picked up a whore. They see Jam and tell him that they will slit his throat if he tries to escape again and the guard tells him that he has to fuck him up a little bit before they go back to the ship. Mog offers to beat him up for stealing his Dweth. Mog swings at Jam and she chooses to be hit and pretends it really hurt but she only takes 2 damage. We all walk back to the hotel.

Alf sees the bruise on Jam’s face and asks Bro if he is the one who disciplined her, he says yes that he takes care of his own, Alf approves. Alf asks what they’re going to do about Tonfir, Bro tells him to tell them everything they know about him. Alf says that he has been seen at the port towns of Aylesbury, and Klad if he’s not on the water. Bro asks about Zadira and says that she might be at one of those towns and that he would’ve murdered her if not for how rich and established her parents are. Alf is not convinced that Bro’s crew can get this done as they are insubordinate and crazy and he thinks he should murder them. Bro tells him his crew is unlike any other and they get shit done. Fur stands behind bro eating eggs, Mog is snorting Dweth, Ohm is touching Alf’s thigh, Jam is Dwethod Acting. Alf is uncertain but trusts us and we’re given a month to go bring back Tonfir’s head. Alyssa and Georgie are going to stay behind as insurance.

We set sail at first light but we have the night together to prepare. Jam feels a kick at the back at his foot and his contact tells him that “She’s still waiting to meet you”. The contact tells Jam that she’s waiting for him in Klad and Jam tells him that we’re on our way there. The contact tells him that he needs to meet with her as soon as he gets to Klad. Helga (Mer’s WHORE NAME) is around the hotel, she looks for an important security guard, she finds a goliath who approaches her. She rolls for performance to make him her bitch and CRITS. He is putty in her hand. We all turn in for the night. Mogali goes back to his room and sees somebody sitting in a chair in the corner and he’s glowing and says “It’s good to see you again”. FIN

## Session 32

> 9/13/22 *Chores*

Mermista is disguised as Helga the Whore.  Mogali turns in for the night, as he closes the door to his room he hears a voice that says “It’s good to see you again.”  He appears to be in a bright meadow, there’s an 8 ft tall pastel colored creature in robes.  The creature can change size and color, it shrinks to 7 ft and sits down.  Mog says “tell me where it’s at?”.  The creature wonders why he still wears his mask in front of his friends.  He slaps his scarred face and tells it that it’s because of what happened to him.  Mogali comes back all pissed off into the bedroom after coming back from the other dimension. He tosses Lil Budgie out of the window and tries to shove Jamison.  Jam sends Claudio out to help LB but cannot reach him in time.  Jam is pissed and calls Mog a child.

Next morning Bronson wakes up in his suite all refreshed and takes a fresh cup of coffee with a little dweth and he enjoys his fresh papaya.  He goes out the door and notices no guards and he heads to the living quarters of his crew and no guards are there as well.  Jam uses Thaumaturgy to tell Bronson that Mog is a fucking child. Bro brings Mog into his suite and gives him some papaya to calm him down and he just vents to Bro about Jam being an asshole. Bro just listens like a good friend and is shocked at how insensitive Jamison is.  Mermista is in the bed dressed as Helga and the goliath is on the floor sleeping like a dog and loving it in accordance to Mer’s rules.  Mer demands some money and info for her services.  She demands that he sneaks her onto the ship that the rest of the crew is on.  He can barely make eye contact with her but he tells her that she will be on the ship with him.

We hear a knock on the door it’s Helga and her manslave and she meets up with us. Nobody has come to get us and we ask the Goliath when we are leaving. Gol asks permission from Helga to go down and check what’s going on with security. Jam asks Bro what’s wrong with Mog, Bro tells him that he was very cruel to Mog and that Mog said he would react exactly like he is. Bro is under the assumption that Jam killed Lil Budgie. We all gather up our stuff and board the ship that is heading out to kill Tonfir 2 Barrels. We see some of Alfonso’s crew preparing the ship. Alyssa is nowhere to be found. Mogali is in a mood and demands that Alf’s crew loads up his blacksmithing tools. Jam tries to find out where Al is and they tell him that she is by the docks.

We go to the docks and see Alyssa’s ships, and supplies are being put onto Wrath. We see Alyssa with her hands bound. Alf motions for Bro to come over and Bro tells him that he will show him how reliable his crew is and that Tonfir will be taken care of. Jam tries to give Al a hug before we leave and he gives a quick hug but Al whispers “Don’t trust him”. Alf asks Bro if he’s ready to depart and he makes it seem like he’s coming with us. Bro tells papa that they work better alone, and he successfully persuades papa to stay behind. Bro gently brushes his hand on Alfonso’s cheek, thanking him. Everyone is weirded out by this. Alf offers us another ship and Bro welcomes them and hands them all red shirts so that we can see them easily. Alf tells Bro he gets to name the new ship, Bro instantly calls it the Black Ariel. We bring Choncho and Badonkadonk onto the ship.

The Black Ariel is run by crewmates that are green AF and Alf didn’t waste any of his good crew on them. Bronson uses the Storm Queen Whistle to give us a giant burst of wind for both of the ships and it cuts our sailing time in half. Mogali is working on Ohm’s plate mail and Ohm helps him and all of these memories come flooding in when he returned to his home and found out his entire clan had disappeared. Mog finishes up and the armor looks gorgeous and represents Ohm’s clan’s essence and it has a glow to it.

It’s night time and Ohm looks out into the distance and he notices the outline of a ship, he alerts everyone on board. We can’t tell any insignia on the ship but it is going the same direction as us just at a distance. Furtim uses his Eggle Eyes and he detects that it’s a well armed Cruiser. As the sun comes up we see the city of Klad, at the edge of the city are 100 ft tall stone walls protecting the city (similar to the Collusus of Rhoades). We pull in and Mogali quickly makes us a flag with a sun with sunglasses on to disguise our ship.

We pull into town and it is a busy port city and we get off the ship. Mog goes into town he sees a woman filing her nails telling him about a bakery that we should visit. We visit the bakery, the sign is in the shape of a croissant, it is called Thy Daily Bread. There’s a half orc woman asking us what we want. Jam tells her that Finn from Bug City mentioned their chocolate croissants are supposed to be special. The orc goes to the back and tells us to wait. She signals for all of the patrons to leave and she locks the doors and she opens a door in the back where a male orc in red armor opens the door. All of the sudden Old Maggie appears from the secret door and welcomes us. Mog asks us how the king is doing but she doesn’t have any current knowledge on him. Mog tells her that the last time we saw him there was an Amethyst Dragon and a bunch of Wyrvings. She tells us the kingdom was searching for weapons of war and that the DoDick was the key to everything. Mog tells her that he keeps it in his pocket for safe keepings. We ask her about Tonfir 2 Barrels. Mag guides us to a bar called the Swimming Tortiose to find out more information about Tonfir.
Mogali Jam and Helga head to the Klad library. Ohm and Bro go to the Swimming Tortoise. Furtim starts playing his Zulcoon for money. Ohm and Bro find the tavern they go on separate floors to try and blend in and learn some info on Tonfir. They notice nothing but they see the crowd getting busier as it gets later. At the library they look for information about the how the primordial god was banished to the Conch. All of the sudden 4 books randomly fall to the ground, (IT’S EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR). Helga, Jam and Mog flip through the books. The primordials created the Genasi, but the Gods wanted use them for their own biddings, realizing that the Genasi have the power of the primordials in them. The Genasi have a connection with both the gods and the primordials.

Furtim is at the docks where everyone is working and starts playing his Zulcoon. He sings about Tonfir to see if anyone gives a reaction. He notices a few workers eyeing him but most people are just enjoying his music. He notices a woman pass by and her hair changes color from black to red. Fur crit fails his history check but he notices that she is 5’ 8”. Meanwhile Mog looks up info on Licanthropy, he finds a Highlight Book about the subject but SOMEBODY FINISHED THE PUZZLE ALREADY!!!!

Everyone meets up at the Swimming Tortoise, Fur takes the shape of an average Klad man. When the rest of the crew walks in the crowd goes quiet. In walks a man with a large red beard and he gets handed a beer. Tonfir looks up at Bronson and says “That must be you Bronson Seahawk”. Bronson finishes his ale and smiles at him “What took you so long?” FIN

## Session 33

> 10/4/22 *Diplomacy Part Deux*

The entire bar is full of Tonfir’s crew and everyone is staring at us.  Bronson spins on his barstool and uses the Mirror of the Past on Tonfir.  He sees large waves, Tonfir looks around in a panic, people are yelling and you can see Alfonso’s flag in the distance, and then a bunch of random hand shakes with some people Bro recognizes and others that he doesn’t. Back at the bar only Furtim and Mermista are unrecognized by Tonfir.
Tonfir asks Bro if he wants a beer, Bro says he’d love one and jumps down from the upper story and lands perfectly on a table.  Ohm follows Bro by gingerly trying to hop down as well.   He tries to slowly climb over the railing but it snaps by the weight of his full plate and Ohm crashes onto the floor as the bar is just stunned.  Ohm just brushes himself off and Tonf signals to his crew to circle the tables and surround him in a defensive stance.  All of the guests who had no idea what was going on have left.  Furtim starts playing his Zulcoon and walks up to the second floor while playing.  Mogali is in the corner reading his book.  Helga is drinking her beer still disguised as a dominatrix and looks intimidating.  Jamison goes up to the second floor and grabs a beer.
Tonf bluntly tells Bro that he heard that we’ve been sent to kill him.  Bro tells him he knows he’s been making deals left and right with other pirates trying to kill his father and that Bro might be able to help with a secret weapon.  Bro tells him that the Conch is real and that Alf has found it and if he discovers how to use it everyone is doomed.  Tonf is suspicious of Bro wanting to kill his own father but Bro tells him some info about the Conch that convinces him.  Bro tells him we have 2 weeks to come up with a plan before we have to return to Alfonso.  Tonf tells him he will give his answer in 2 days time.  As Tonf leaves, 3 crewmen blow whistles and instantly the entire crew of Tonf leave the bar, leaving us with just the bar staff.

The bar staff tells Ohm he has to pay for the broken table, he says that he might have a concussion and that they better have insurance.  Jam tries to convince them to leave Ohm alone and tells them that Mog will repair everything better than new.  Mog convinces the bartender that he will fix a bunch of other things around the bar if they find us shelter for the next 2 days.

While all of this is going on, Furtim follows the guys he encountered earlier who didn’t like Tonf.  The guys are clearly on edge but they don’t notice Fur.  They arrive at a huge building on the corner, a lot of the people stopping by the building are part of Tonf’s crew.  Fur goes to the side of a building and gently plays his Zulcoon.

Jam and Ohm talk to the bartenders.  Mog tries to find some amicable Wererats or anything Werelike. They ask about Tonf and they say he’s not too bad, tips well enough.  Jam asks about Zadira, they said she’s been here once and she’s rich as fuck but a real shitty tipper and kinda of an asshole.  She then writes down the name and directions to the inn we were promised for Mog fixing things.  We are to tell them that Laurent said we’re good for the night.  We head for the inn.

We go inside and after we tell the owner that Laurent sent us, and they give us 3 rooms.  He tells us to put our fingers together and all of a sudden the tips of our index fingers turn white and they can now be used as keys to enter our room doors.  However he warns us that at 6 PM tomorrow our keys won’t work and he tells us we have one minute to leave the room immediately… or else.  We go to our rooms meanwhile Furtim is still on the streets.

Fur is trying to lure out some of the guys he was following by playing the same song he played on the docks but nobody comes out. He goes back to the Swimming Tortoise and they tell him to go to the inn. He touches tips with the owner and gets a key for the night. We all go to sleep and wake up feeling well rested.

Helga goes into the town to look for some magic items. She catches the eye of one particular store. She looks in the window and sees 3 items in a display case. She notices a particular pair of bracers in the display case that she wants. She rings the bell to get the attention of the shop keeper. It’s a halfling woman with white hair, and Mer is handed the bracers. She tries them on and loves them but the woman tells her they cost 500 gold. Mer is able to haggle her down to 400 and buys the Bracers of Defense which raise her AC by 2 and they look like Ice Avatar themed bracers. Jam disguises Bro as a far off merchant with rings in his beard and gold rings on his fingers, his hair and beard have flairs of blue and black with gold fleck all in them.

Blue and white flag with dove at bar.

## Session 34

> 10/25/22 *Troubled Waters*

We are all in a divey bar, there is a faint light in the room, we head down some stairs.  We look around and adjust to light, Ohm and Mogali ask for a tankard of ale.  Ohm notices a group of three guys staring at Ohm and only at him.  Ohm slides the silver for the ale at the barkeep and whispers to him, “who are those fuckboys in the back?”.  He responds, they’re with the empire, “who are you?”.   The BK is very confused.  Mog gives the BK some coins to give those guys some drinks.  The BK gives the drinks to Mog and he snags them up and brings them to the suspicious gentlemen.  He offers them 7 minutes in heaven for 5 gold a minute with Ohm.  The suspicious lads tell Mog they’re about to turn in it for the night so they better not indulge.  Mog uses a spirit to tell Ohm to leave the building and to signal the rest of the group to follow suit.  Ohm pretends he’s drunk and spills all over himself and tries to leave.  
The guys see Ohm trying to leave and ignore Mog, Mog tells him about the Clown Arc in its entirety, but the guys are too distracted from this shitty side arc.  Ohm leaves successfully and the guys are paying attention to Mog.  Furtim hears the clown story and gets sick and has to leave, but as he’s dry heaving, Mermista is trying to leave at the same time.  The only ones left in the room are the three guys, the bartender, Mogali and Bronson.  They keep asking Mog about his dwarven friend and Mog tells him the Wharf is by the water.  They tell Mog at the order of the Kingdom they must take him in.  Mog casts Sanctuary on himself.  Bronson sees this and immediately casts Hex on the guy bullying Mog, Bro cuts through him like butter yelling “STAND YOUR GROUND, THIS IS A CITIZEN’S ARREST” instantly killing him.  One of the other guys grabs Mog, and the other tries to attack Bro but he deflects both of them.  Mog casts Englarge on himself and escapes his grasp and walks away towards the door.  Ohm hears the disturbance going inside and gives the performance of his life trying to distract everyone else outside by falling down drunk and rolling on the ground.  People are not trying to make eye contact with Ohm.  Mermista runs over to Ohm “OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD, HE IS OVERDOSING FROM DWETH!” She puts her hand on his cheek and claims “HE HAS NO PULSE!”.  Nobody wants to get involved with these weirdos.  Mog sics Lil Budgie on the guy trying to grab onto him, LB does 8 damage.  Mog then stabs the guy on the ground with his Halberd, “THE SPIRITS HAVE CHOSEN YOU” he rips the halberd from the chest of guy 2 and stares into the soul of guy 3 “THE SPIRITS HAVE CHOSEN YOU NEXT”.  

Bronson passes his curse onto G3 as he is desperately grabbing for the bathroom door.  He looks him dead in the eye and yells “THAT’S MY PURSE, I DON’T KNOW YOU!” He swings his sword into his balls. He then whispers “You’re so lucky they chose you.” He then stabs him in his ear.  Mog dips his hand in some of the blood and writes MURDERING MIKE WAS HERE, YOU SAW NOTHING, ILF FOR LIFE.  Mog and Bro search the bodies of the dead kings guard, we find some coins, some keys, and a piece of paper and he leaves. Bro casts fire bolt at several kegs of ale in the bar.  They both leave outside the secret back door bar entrance where the bartender ran out of but nobody is there.  As the bar is slowly starting to burn, Ohm notices something glowing inside of the bar, he slaps his knee and hits the dusty trail with Furtim and Mermista.

All of a sudden some bells start ringing around town.  A fire squad starts coming as well as the clank clank clank of the towns guard.  We split up, Mog and Bro go down the alley that the bartender escaped down and Mer, Ohm and Fur go down the main road.  The fire squad uses magic to constantly create water from these backpacks to put out the fire.  The guards ask the locals what happened.  Ohm, Mer, and Fur are able to blend in with the crowd and escape unnoticed.  Bro and Mog are running down the alley back towards the streets towards the rest of the crew.  Mog gives a very convincing performance about how much he hates fire, Bro says it’s so cold.  We are reunited.  We head back to our hotel to read the letter Mog took off of one of the dead Queen’s Guards.

Mog reads the note, it’s a letter for the empire, it mentions private Marcus, it is an IOU for lodging the Queen’s soldiers.  In the IOU, it reads that this receipt can be used to house the entire unit, the Eagle’s Rest.  Bro and Mer look at each other and instantly recognize the name, we know that it is very close and it is a chain hotel for housing the Queen’s Guard. We decide to check it out.  We notice a note on the table, it’s in Jamison’s handwriting, “Emergency.. Going to meet the bakers”.

We head towards the Eagle’s Rest, Mog tells Ohm that he now has a blood oath to keep to Mog to find out Werewolf shit for Mog since Mog made him that epic full plate mail.  Ohm swears that he will keep that oath.  Mog takes a huge puff of Dweth and gains boosts to his Strength and Intelligence. 

Furtim notices as we get closer to this hotel chain, there are more and more people in Imperial Armor.  There are 12 groups of soldiers trying to do a head count and notice that some are missing.  Above the square are magical orbs of lights acting as spotlights.  They’re doing role calls to all of the soldiers.  Furtim tries faking a “Here” call everytime one of the soldiers doesn’t respond.  Bronson and Mer go and look around the Eagle’s Rest hotel since they are  familiar with it and in full disguise. Mer sees that there are 12 groups about 8 each doing a head count, she sees officer insignias all around.  We go up to the concierge and tell her we are looking for a room.  She runs to go check if there’s a room, we see the ledger on her desk and we take a peek at it.  Mer looks at all the names, she recognizes some of them, all sign ins of military personell and they all arrived 5 or 6 days ago. The one name we recognize is Marcus Mare. The concierge comes back and tells us that there are no more rooms available.  She gives us an etched coin that gives us 20 percent off any of their sister hotels.  Mog uses his telepathy to find out what happens if we stayed at this one hotel past 6.  At the mention of this hotel she clenches up in fear a bit, and just says uhhh…. Nobody knows. Mer uses the Medallion of Thoughts on her and she is in pure fear of that hotel, all she knows is that we should not bet there past 6:01.  Mer tries to dig deeper but the concierge knows she’s trying to pry into her mind.

We go to the 20 percent off hotel, but as we head there, 3 individuals start speed walking towards us.  They are part of Tonfir’s crew, they are pissed, “WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU GUYS DO?”.  Everyone says that you guys burned down a bar with 3 royal guards in them.  Mog successfully tricks them with his Dwethod Acting skills.  They tell us that the timeline has moved up and that we have to decide by morning. FIN

## Session 35

> 11/22/22? *Dark Clouds*

Jamison is watching the chaos unfold at the burning bar and sees Bronson and Mogali nonchalantly sneaking away from the building down a back alley.  He then notices the fire brigade charging in and they start pulling out bodies.  Jam goes to see his contact, “the bakers”, but he immediately knows that everything is going to get out of control immediately and that the group is responsible for everything.  

Jam goes to an ocean bar filled with locals.  He sees a young fisher drinking by himself.  Jam asks if he heard about the bar that burnt down, he said he did and that they pulled out like 5 bodies.  The fisher says that the kingdom is mobilizing at the Eagles Nest and that things are getting tense.  Jam asks if he knows where she can find any “baked goods” wink wink. He tells her that he knows a guy nearby but flour is in short supply.  He asks when Jam needs to meet the baker and how many she is “baking” for.  Jam says just himself and as soon as possible.  The fisher hands him a copper and tells him to hang onto it.  It gets darker and Jam’s contact 
“Bob” is furious about all of the drama that the party has caused with the dead soldiers.  Bob tells Jam that his party has ruined everything for his spies now that the Empire is so on edge.  Bob puts his hood up and tells him that he will contact  him later.  Jam goes back in to town and sees the party talking to Tonfir’s crew and knows that we’re in trouble.

Tonfir leads the party to a boat, Mogali is crawling up the gang plank to be as obnoxiously slow as possible.  Tonfir is pissed but Mog tells him that it wasn’t our fault and we need to band together as friends to take down the empire and Alfonso Seahawk.  Tonfir says we need to run away from here and move up the plan to kill Alf.  He tells us we have until sunrise to decide our next move.  

We leave the ship and Jam bird calls out to Mog, he then sends Claudio in snake form to crawl all over Mog.  Mog throws stupid, sexy, Claud to the ground and Jam reveals himself.  He starts yelling at Mog for making things so much worse and now the friendly spies are more underground and that we need to escape before we all get arrested.

The party comes up with the shittiest plan possible and we decide to go with Tonfir to kill Alfonso, meanwhile we alert the Kingdom to where we will be located.  THEN we will summon the Kraken to kill everyone… OPERATION MAX CHAOS.  Mog sends a letter to the military base addressed to Bridgette telling them of where we will be meeting.  

Mer goes to a port side bar and orders the strongest drink they have. Mer starts asking the bartender about Tonfir and hopes she doesn’t die tomorrow.  Bronson takes off his merchant disguise and sits at the sea wall.  A small child looks up to Bro, he asks what his vessel is called, “Tenesta” named after her sister. Bronson does the responsible thing and gives him a longsword and tells him if he wants anything in this world he has to take it for himself.    Furtim is talking a to a mysterious woman but he knows that he’s spoken to her before (THE HIPSTER ZULCOON FAN).  He offers to serenade her with his zulcoon, she tries to dart away from him in the crowd but his Eggle Eyes are too strong and he sees her turn shape, SHE’S A FUCKING CHANGLING.

It’s morning time and we see Tonfir and 2 of his men show up behind us.  We tell him that we’re coming with him to kill Alfonso and that we have a plan to fake his death with Furtim pretending to be him.  Jam tells Ton the plan to stage his death in order to win Alf’s trust.  Mog tells him a plan to load one of the boats full of gun powder and ram it into Alf’s ship. Tonfir tells us that we are leaving now.  We start going to our ship and we prepare to depart.  Tonfir gives Mog a magical earpiece so that they can communicate with each other. EVERYTHING REMINDS US OF THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM! 
As we are leaving, Mermista feels a tug on her mind and soul, she feels like she is falling through water and she ends up in water that is eerily still.  All a sudden a voice reaches out to her, “You keep up your end, and I’ll keep up mine”.  Mermista in real life stumbles backwards as her eyes are rolled back and a splash of water erupts when she hits the deck and she regains consciousness.  Clouds start rolling in… DARK CLOUDS. These don’t look like normal clouds and they are forming too rapidly.  Mer is now CONKCIOUS!!! 

We’ve seen these clouds once before… it was 2015 at RAINFURREST AT THE SEATTLE HILTON… HUMANITY LEFT THE WORLD THAT DAY.  Mermista is waking up and water is evaporating around her. We’re not too worried it was just a LITTLE SEIZURE… PIZZA PIZZA.  The water is kind of choppy, but it starts to get glassy as time goes on.  Ohm is praying to Grox and he feels a warmth near him, a connection, calling to him back from the mainland that we left.  

Mog calls Tonfir and tells him that he knows where the dark clouds are coming from and that we have the Conch.  There is a very long pause… Tonfir says he really wished he knew this from the beginning.  Ton’s lead ship lines up next to ours and he boards our ship and Mogali just offers him up the Conch.  Ton just grabs it and asks us how to use it.  We tell him just to blow into it and he will have the ultimate power.  Ton raises it to his lips and gives a GREAT BLOW JOB.  All of the waves in the ocean just disappear, the sky turns to night.  The sky is spreading black and glass waves move slowly in the ocean.  Bro feels his Storm Whistle vibrating faster and faster in his pocket.  Tonfir lets out a blood curtling scream as his lips start to turn black and crustaceans form on his skin, he is in horrible mental and physical pain.  Black ooze leaves his lips as Mermista can hear a voice coming from Tonfir’s mind… “NOT THIS ONE”.

The storm whistle is humming in Bro’s pocket as we hear a call from Tonfir’s crew yelling “SHHHHIIIIPPPP”.  PAPA HAS RETURNED TO HAVE A CATCH!!!! FIN

> ## Session 36

> 12/13/22? *The Family You Choose  (AKA The 3 Shell Game)*

A gray sky blankets everything, the ocean turns grayish green. Tonfir is screaming in pain and black ooze leaks from his face and small barnacles and ocean creatures are crawling all over his face.  Everyone else on the ship is freaking out seeing what is happening to Tonfir.  We all start freaking out in order to maintain our innocence.  Tonfir is slowly turning into a kraken creature.  Mogali is trying to throw Tonfir into the ocean.  Tonfir is not dying but turning, Ohm tries to help by smashing him with his hammer, he hits him for 15 fire damage.  Bronson is screaming “Oh my god Tonfir has been possessed by the ancient kraken primordial we have to kill him before he kills all of us!!!!!”  Bro attacks twice and Crits for a total of 26 damage with his sword.  Bro starts to hear a voice in his head, he recognizes it immediately… “There’s a lot of explaining to do hear…” It’s his Papa Alfonso.  Bro screams in his mind… “Papa I’m trying to kill him just like you asked, he had the Conch the whole time!!!”  Alf sounds amused and proud “Good boy I’m coming for you”.  Alf opens his sails and speeds towards us.

Tonfir’s crew is terrified and don’t know what to do.  His first mate is asking Bro what the fuck is going on.  Bro slaps him and gives him an epic nautical themed speech yelling him to get it together.  He is apprehensive but he’s on board.  Krakfir attempts to grapple Mermista but she evades it.  A deep voice comes from Krakfir… It’s Vrirri the ancient Primordial… he tells Mer to “Honor the Deal”.  The voice is so loud and powerful that we all have to make a Cha save.   Everyone except Bro is ok, he is officially Frightened for 1 minute.  Mogali attacks for 13 damage, and Lil Budgie rips off one of his arms for another 12 damage.  Mer attacks with her QS for a total of 15 damage.  She then uses her bare hands to reach into its skull where the hammer had it cracked open, she rips its skull open but as it dies it yells “THE DEAL”.  Bro hears his father in his head say “What happened?” “THE PLAN WORKED PERFECTLY, TONFIR IS DEAD MOST OF HIS CREW IS DECIMATED, AND WE ARE WAITING FOR YOU TO GET HERE TO FINISH OFF THE SURVIVORS!”.  Mogali convinces Ton’s first mate that our plan is still to attack Alf’s ship by loading up our boat full of gun powder and ramming it.  

Our party is meditating and calmly playing around waiting for Alfonso to arrive.  Everything about plan Max Chaos has worked out so far.  Mogali reaches into his bag of holding for a second and pulls out the decoy Conch and embues it with magic.  Jamison sends Claudio out to go spy.  Mer finally takes off her Dominatrix outfit and returns to her monk form.  Bro uses his Mirror of the Past on the Conch to learn more about it and hopefully how to wield it.  As he looks into the mirror, he sees a massive figure before him, it’s a giant eye, fast forward, a large ocean with a bunch of ships with a ton of water genasis (ORANGE NAZIS).  There is a beautiful other worldly women in front of the genasis, the armada of genasis are now being attacked by a giant kraken. One of the genasis grabs the conch and a blinding light comes from it and that is the end of the vision.  Bro relays everything he saw to the party.  Alf’s ships are preparing to board, and his men are armed.  We command the ship to stop in order to prepare for the Parlay with Alfonso.  Ton’s crew are visibly nervous.  Bronson grabs Tonfir’s infamous two pistols from his dead disformed body to prove that he is dead.

Alfonso is fully decked out in epic pirate war gear and boards the ship with Alyssa in tow and his closest crew.  Bronson gives him a giant hug and shows him the two pistols and whispers in his ear, “Tonfir’s crew still trusts us, kill them all.”  Alfonso is so proud of him and snaps his fingers as his crew tears apart the surviving crew of Tonfir.  The other two ships of Tonfir start firing upon us as we engage in NAVAL COMBAT.

We now have all of Alf’s ships on our side as well as our 2 ships.  Alf prepares to attack with his other ships but he stops in his tracks when he sees Mermista now in her normal form.  “Who are you?” “Who am I?... (PETEY PABLO MOTHERFUCKERS, TAKE YO SHIRT OFF) I’m the one who killed Tonfir, that’s who I am.”  Alf smiles gleefully, “This day just keeps getting better and better.” RUH RO.  We all board Alf’s ships and then Mog has LB waiting below deck to blow up the ship, Mog sends the signal.  We all roll Dex saves and everyone other than Mog are knocked prone and take 10 or 5 damage.  Alf’s ship has a very large hole in it and everyone is pretending that it was a booby trap set by old Booby Trap Tonfir as his close friends called him.  Alf picks up Bro and asks him if he’s ok, Bro tells him Tonfir must’ve set a trap for us and his crew used it when they were being murdered.  Alf looks directly at Mer and tells Bro to have her release the true power of the Conch.  Bro hands her the fake conch and she blows into it but nothing happens.  She tells him that she’s not attuned to it.  She hands him the conch and he is furious and crushes the conch. WE ALL GASP. TRICKY TONFIR STRIKES AGAIN.  Alf is furious and backhands her for 6 damage.  Mer tries to punch him and he reacts with lightning speed and catches her punch.  Bro gets in between them and she spits at Alf.  Alf tells his men to grab her, she fights off one of them but the other one grabs her.  Ohm tries to clog one of the cannons to  blow up as a distraction making it look like a an accident, the explosion goes off and Ohm is saved by his Dex roll.  

Mogali goes and runs at Bronson as everyone is confused and tries to grapple him but fails his strength check.  Everyone of Alf’s crew surrounds Mog and Mer breaks free from her guy and WE ALL ROLL INITIATIVE!!! FIN

> ## Session 37

> 1/10/23 *… So Below (Honey I Shrunk the Map)*

We are all super tiny. Mermista had just spit on Alfonso, he attempts to grab her by the throat again. He succeeds and demands to know where the real conch is.  He goes to strike her and misses.  Jamison runs to one of the remaining cannons and fires it at the ships that have the remaining crew of Tonfir’s men. Jam yells at Alf to focus on our mission.  Jam slips away to a particularly sneaky spot of the ship and stealths.  Mermista tries to lie her way out of Alf’s grip, he doesn’t buy it and grabs her throat harder.  Mer then tries to break his grip and fails again.  Furtim shoots 2 Eldritch blasts at the metal grate that leads us to the lower decks.  Ohm attacks Alf with his War Hammer for 9 damage right to the ribs on the side of his outstretched arm.  Georgie goes to help Alf and incites an Opp Att from Jam attacks her with his sword for an assassination Sneaky Snatch Attack for 32 damage. Mogali flanks Georgie, but takes Opp Att damage from one of the Bosun for 9 damage.  He appears behind Alyssa and CRITS as he kicks her handcuffs free with his boot spiders. The first mate attacks Ohm for 9 damage with his longsword.  Bronson just sees his papa lose all sense of emotion, and he knows what happens when he gets angry.  Bro unleashes his Water Weird while casting hex on Georgie, he hits for a combined 14 damage.  Geo rips Jam’s dagger out of her leg and then used Evasive Footwork.  Bro misses with his second attack.  Bro’s WW uses constrict on Bosun D and water chokes him for 16 damage and drags him towards the edge of the ship.

Alf’s veins start to bulge, he smiles and the clouds start to get darker, he uses his Storm Aura to start to rage.  He looks directly at Ohm, he grabs his Scimitar to attack Ohm while his other hand is still choking Mer.  Ohm blocks the direct hit but the lightning secondary damage strikes him for 4 damage.  Alf finally drops Mer.

Jam attacks Geo with his extra dagger, he hits that bitch with both of his daggers for 34 damage, she is super fucked up and holding herself up. Pirate 1 pulls out his hammer and attacks Mog but misses.  Mer attacks Bosun D and CRITS with her staff for 11 damage, she uses her second attack and CRITS AGAIN and shoves her staff down his throat and sits on the staff.  She uses her fist and CRITS AGGGGGAAAAIIINNN and fists the Captain for 10 damage.  Bosun B misses Mer. Bos C attacks Bro and misses.  Alyssa is now free and switches places with Georgie to protect her (Muff Divers of the Deep). Furtim does 2 more EBs to the center grate for 13 damage.  Ohm cast Word of Grox and everyone passed, Ohm is sad. Ohm heals himself 13 HP.
FIN!!!

> ## Session 38

> 1/24/22? *The Ties That Bind*

Georgie tries to run off the ship but incurs an opp attack from Mogali but he misses, she dashes to the front edge of the ship. Rufio TRIES TO CHEAT… AGAIN (Man he sure hates the Trans Community!).  Now that order has been restored, Jamison takes his turn and shoots his bow at Georgie and he MUTILATES HER WITH HIS ARROW FOR 16 DAMAGE AS SHE YELLS “YOU’RE ARE A TERRIBLE LESBIAN”... THE BOW PIERCES HER HEART right before Geo was about to drink a potion. Geo dies and falls overboard. (Rufio and Dia belong together with their homophobic hatred).  Alyssa is absolutely horrified as she sees what Jam just did to her Beaver Buddy. Al looks absolutely betrayed.  Furtim attacks the metal grate again with 2 Eldritch Blasts, it is falling apart but still standing.  Avatar got nominated for best picture. Mermista is packing for travel. Merm attacks bosun C for 18 to hit. 8 damage. 24 hit to Bosun C another 8 dmg. Unarmed strike for bonus action, 22 to hit, 5 dmg. He gets black eye and looks like a bitch or something. Alphonso is blue guy. Bronson attack Brosun C with his sword and chops his head off.  Bro then attacks Brosum A and misses.  Bro’s Water Weird also rolls a 2 in solidarity with Bro and misses.  

Mogali reaches into his pockets and starts taking a big swig from one of his bags as he aims his acid vomit and Brosun A and E and the grate.  Both guys fail their dex save and each take 10 acid damage.  Captain B attacks Mer and hits with a hook for 11 damage and she is grappled.  First Mate attacks Ohm with a longsword and misses twice. Brosun A panics and runs and tries to wipe the acid off of himself incurring Opp Atts from Bro and Fur, only Fur hits for 6 damage with his rapier.  Alf just goes eerily calm and looks like he is talking to himself inside his head.  Alf just looks directly at Ohm, his irises start to break and his eyes go completely black, and giant tentacles arise from the water.  Alf’s Scimitar has the black ink dripping from it, the same ink that is dripping from Alf’s face.  He hits Ohm and it feels like his organs are being dragged by the scimitar and he takes 12 damage.  Ohm fails his dex save and takes and additional 8 lightning damage.  Cap A leaves the wheel to shoot at Mog with his hand bow, HE CRITS and Mof takes 8 piercing damage.

Alyssa is wiping her tears away from her face as she looks at Jam, she attacks Cap A with her rapier for 7 damage. Ohm attacks the First Mate with his hammer for 7 total damage.  Ohm calls upon the spiritual weapon to attack the FM from behind to smash down on him with flames for 18 damage.  Jam attacks Bros F and misses.  The grate melts and Bro and Fur fall down below decks, Bro takes 6 and Fur takes 1 falling damage.  Fur takes a look around and notices food storage, no eggs to Furtim’s dismegg.  Fur enhanced to full strength.  Mer attacks Cap B and hits with her fist for 7 damage, she uses a ki point for Patient Defense.  Bro uses Misty Step to get above deck and attack Bros A.  Bro swiftly hits twice once across his stomach and then once straight through his chin instantly killing him.  Bro’s WW constricts Bros F and drags him towards him away from Mog for 15 damage.  Mog attacks Alf with Branding Smite but misses, he attacks again and should’ve smashed him but Alf uses Uncanny Dodge and it grazes him for 8 damage.

Cap B attacks Mer and whiffs twice.  FM misses on Mog. Tentacle 1 hits Mog for 15 Bludgeoning damage and then grapples him.  Tent 2 attacks Ohm for 14 damage and is also grappled.  We feel the boat lurch forward as something is attached to it.  Mer is attacked by Tent 3 but just barely fights it off.  She steps out of the way of the lightning with her Evasion and dodges again.  Cap A attacks Al for 19 total damage.  Bros E takes 3 acid damage, then attacks Jam but misses both times.  Bros F jumps off of the ship fearing for his life not realizing that he is jumping straight into the tentacles.  Al misses her attack.  Ohm uses his Inflict Wounds and CRITS on his tentacle for a WHOPPING 72 damage and it starts pouring out the black ink and is severly fucked up.  WIth Ohm’s bonus his spiritual hammer attacks Alf and fails.  Jam attacks Bro E and hits with both daggers, slicing every major artery and finishing with the carotid, killing him.  FIN!!!

> ## Session 39

> 2/28/22 *Low Tide*

We are fighting Alfonso, the Brosuns, and the Tentacles.  Furtim is up first, he is still below deck and he can see the tentacles from the cannon holes, he chucks a cannonball at T1 and it makes the cannon hole bigger and hits for 9 damage.  Jamison uses his magic daggers to attack Cap A, both of them hit for a total of 39 damage, he steps on the dead body in front of him to help leap in the air and both daggers enter the lungs of Cap A and he collapses DED. Mermista attacks Alf w her staff for 7 damage but he uses Uncanny Dodge and only takes 3 damage.  She misses her strike on Cap B.  She then attacks T2 for 9 damage and runs away. Bronson casts Hex on T2, he hits it once with his sword for 15 damage, his Water Weird misses.  Mogali calls upon his spirits to hit T2 after missing and hits for 13 damage.  Cap B attacks Bro with his sword for 6 damage.  The First Mate tries to save himself and jumps off the boat but incurs an Opportunity Attack from Mog, his halberd chops off FM’s head and then nudges his headless body off of the boat. 
 The Kraken attacks Mer for 15 damage and grapples her. T2 squeezes Ohm a little harder and lifts him off the ground and swings him into Bro but Bro dodges and Ohm takes 7 damage.  Ohm saves himself from falling into the grate but he is still prone.  Mer is dragged under the water by one of the Ts.  She notices an open portal in the ocean where all the Tentacles are coming from.  She hears a voice “Release me, we had a deal!” One of the Ts strikes a wall near Jam looking for him but he dodges it in stealth.  Alfonso attacks Mog and misses but hits him with his Storm Aura for 4 damage.  Alyssa sprints towards Alf and attacks and hits with both weapons for a whopping 23 damage, no words, just a guttural scream.  Ohm gracefully stands up and targets Alf with his Spirit Axe, he hits for 16 Force Damage. Ohm then runs over and hits Alf with his hammer for 4 damage.
Jam uses his magic daggers to hit Cap B and hits with one for 18 sneak attack damage. (EVERYONE HAD A NICE CLIPPY LAUGH) Fur unleashes to EBs and CRITS for one and hits for the other for 19 damage to one of the Ts.  He then gives Bardic Inspiration to Ohm.  Mer successfully frees herself from the Ts grapple.  Mer jumps back onto the ship and attacks Cap B twice for a combined 15 damage, shoving her staff up his ass rupturing his organs.  She then uses her Unarmed Strike to punch Alf in the face for 7 damage.  Bro attacks the Ts with his sword and hits for 16 damage.  Mog uses Smite on Alf and hits for 21 damage, and then hits again for another 9 damage.  Mog swings wildly with his halberd, one deep into Alf’s shoulder, then another wild swing takes off Alf’s head and it lights up like a disco ball. As his head lands on the ground he looks deeply into Bronson’s eyes before the light leaves his eyes.  Moments after the tentacles begin to retreat to the ocean.  One tentacle grabs Mer’s arm and she hears a voice say “We had a deal”.  The tentacle grabbed her arm so hard that it left a murky discoloration on her arm.  
In the distance we hear a loud crack as a Alf’s second ship is being destroyed by 8 galleons with blue and white flags and they are heading our way!!!!  Bronson blows into the Storm Whistle and yeets us in the opposite direction.  Furtime notices w his Eggle Eyes 3 people standing on the deck of the main galleon but he can’t determine who it is. (Might be Hash Brown!!!!) Bronson goes up to the corpse of his dead PaPa and grabs his Scimitar and he notices the hilt has tiny spikes, he takes it, it’s the Sword (Scimitar) of Vengeance FIN!!! WE LEVEL UP

> ## Session 40

> 3/21/23 *Reconciliation*

As we use the Storm Whistle, we yeet our ship towards Baneshold away from the Queen’s Armada.  Jamison is observing Alyssa, he walks up to her to check on her, Al is cold and tells Jam that he didn’t have to kill Georgie.  Al asks if the empire is chasing us. She thanks Mogali for killing Alfonso.  Bronson is alone in the captain’s quarters trying to process what just happened.  His father’s scimitar lays on the table in front of him.  Bronson goes through his dad’s stuff and finds some gems worth 50 gold and a map of places that he had been, clearly Alfonso was trying to find Bro.  Alyssa approaches Mermista and Mer says she held up her end of the deal, “Where are my people?”  Al tells her that she will send word back to Bug City to free her people.  Mer does a perception check on her arm with the weird mark left my the Kraken.  Her hand feels like it’s in a body of water and looks like murky water.  She feels like her hand is starting to lose sensation.

Ohm starts working on repairing the ship after he finishes his beans.  He casts 4th level Fabricate on it (Fantasia music starts playing).  Furtim is below deck having fun looking for explosives.  Mer meditates while holding the Conch and looks inwards, she sees a body of water and a rumbling begins, a giant eye emerges and asks her what she is doing here.  Mer wants to get rid of the curse and she says it wasn’t her fault that Alf died.  When she looks at her arm in the water, she can only see her wrist.  She feels the curse in her arm slowly starting to spread but she CRITS and is able to regain control.  She wakes up and feels like she is covered in swamp water.  

We arrive at Baneshold we see cliffs and different merchant ships, we see a massive arch that is so much larger than we though due to low tide.  We see a glowing green entrance to a sea cave.  Alyssa tells us to go towards the cave,  Mermista steers the ship and the little green light is guiding us through the cave.  Mer is able to safely steer us through the cave for 15-20 minutes, we finally arrive at a large clearing, we see 2 giant ports for ships.  Ohm and Jam CRIT their perception checks, they can tell that many people are staring at our ship because we are still flying the flag of Alfonso. The water level in the cave is rising and so is our ship.  Inside the cavern is a massive city, with buildings carved into the walls. A half elf and half orc in authoritative garb approach us and welcome us.  They are confused by Alfonso’s flag and inform us of how much it would cost to repair the ship.  Mog gives them some silver and tells them that we want to trade the ship.  They inform us that we can do it inside the city.  Mog tells them we want to find an inn to rest and regroup.  We pay them 7 gold to repair the ships.  Gregory is the half orc Thom’son is the half elf.

Mog asks about a local library and we decide to leave Claudio on the boat to report back to us.  Ohm does a stone check since he realizes some of the buildings were built by dwarves.  He can tell this buildings are very old, it is strange to see Dwarvish architecture near water and it appears that they might have collaborated with somebody else to make the city.  

It is midday in the city and Mog and Mer go to the library, Ohm and Jam go to a tavern, Bro looks for some dwarvish armorers.  Alyssa gets off the ship and gives Jam a very deep hug, she tells Jam she loves him and that she is leaving.  She pulls out a piece of quartz that has been smoothed over and carved into, it is a Sending Stone so that Jam can reach Al if he ever needs her.  She goes to Mer and thanks her for everything, she swears on her life that Mer’s people will be safe when she gets back to Bug City.  Al extends her hand to Mer and Mer shakes it firmly with her fucked up hand.  Al comes to Bro and tells him she wishes she could say that she is sorry for his loss, she says that if she ever sees him again that she will kill him.  She blames Bro for getting her crew killed.  Bro tells her that she knew that she would have to sacrifice everything to beat his father and he tells that if she feels that way then it is what it is.  Al disappears into the crowd.

Bronson is going to find armor but he can’t find the dwarven armor shop he is looking for.  Furtim looks for a music shop, he sees people moving around a town square some with instruments.  He sits down and plays a song and casts Detect Magic to seek a new magical instrument but he can’t find anything, he still looks like one of Alf’s crewmates.  Ohm and Jam head to find a local tavern.  They find a store with a bunch of plants everywhere and a gnome shopkeep pops up and asks them what they’re looking for.  He asks if they’re with the City Guard and they both say no.  Jam is looking for a poison shop but doesn’t want to directly say that so he is trying to nonchalantly ask for a special store that might be good to protect oneself.  The gnome is starting to catch on and asks if Jam wants something aerosol or liquid.  Jam wants 2 “special” potions that can take out somebody reliably.  One is a smoke bomb and one is a poison that can be used 4 times.  Jam successfully persuades the gnome to lower the price to 8 gold and Ohm wants whatever he is smoking as well as information.  Ohm shows him the emblem of the Fire Forge clan but doesn’t say the name.  The gnome tells him that there is a Dwarven Archive in the city and draws him a map.  The gnome asks their names, Jam says his name is Tim and Ohm says his name is Owmpopcha (super sneaky).

Mermista and Mogali make their way towards the upper city, they see these giant walls that go around the city and they get smaller as they reach the edge of the city.  They are directed to this large white 7 storied building with a pyramid top.  They walk in and there is an open area with 7 stories of books.  Mog almost nuts seeing how many books there are.  Mer asks the librarians about any books about getting rid of primordial curses.  She flies up 3 stories and starts moving books with magic, she goes higher and higher and grabs several books about curses and primordials, some overlapping info.  Mer decides to rent the books, she then rolls for investigation and CRITS, she learns that now her arm is part primordial, the deal that she made is ancient magic and she would need a ritual performed by somebody super powerful that specializes in primordials to remove it.  She finds a list of specialists; Frida the Storm Watcher, and Adora Sibi. 

Ohm and Jam are at the bar and Jam is a little tipsy off of mimosas.  Everyone regroups at the bar and we plan our next move.  FIN

> ## Session 41

> 5/9/23 Solid Ground (Brought to you by the Queer Beer… Budweiser)

It’s a new day in Baneshold, we are at the lower part, underground. These magical lights rise and light up the cavern, they come from dwarven magic.  Jamison steps out to go off on his own and to reflect on losing Alyssa and his public exposure problem. Mogali goes back to the library to rent some books and a blue ribbon wraps around his finger and tightens to remind him to brink back the books.  Furtim stays in his disguise and stays in his room.  

We receive a message from the local stables telling us that our noble steeds are waiting for us.  CHONCHO AND BADONKADONK ARE THRIVING!!!!!!! (Chad grabs another Trans Can).  Mogali is working on Ohm’s armor and trying to turn it into magic +1 armor.  In return, Ohm is reading up on Liconthropy to help Jamison.  A very well dressed Elven man enters the tavern, he is followed by a human.  He pulls up a chair and introduces himself as Zigar Pon (his friends call him Ziga, definitely sounds like a dark elf if you ask me… brought to you by Hobby Lobby).  Jamison comes into the tavern and joins us.  Zigar asks us if we are the owners of the boat, we inform him we are, he asks if we are aware of the owner of the boat.  Bronson (still in disguise) informs him that we are part of a side crew sent to repair his ship.  Zigar is a representative of the Mayor of Baneshold and invites us to dinner later tonight to meet the mayor.

Bronson investigates the city for some better armor, he finds an armor shop that is extremely busy and has bunch of well known armor smiths.  Bro asks one of the workers if they have anything better than chain mail, preferably half plate.  They ask if he wants a custom job, and he wants something that would be personal to him to remind him of Alfonso	that nobody else would know about.  They agree on a price of 710 gold and then he asks Bro what his name is… they reply “Tran’can” (Thank you to our sponsors), he tells “T” that their armor will be ready in 3 days time.  

Mermista goes searching for Frida to try and find out more about her curse, she is asking random transfolk and one them tells her that she is in the high court where the government buildings are.  Jamison hears that the mayor hates Tieflings (completely unfounded but this shit sells) so he is not coming to the dinner.  Jamison decides to help out Mogali with his bizarre grocery list.  Jamison spends the night searching for these items (“the tears of someone who has never cried before”).  Furtim goes ahead to scope out the mayor’s house, he is looking for a way to sneak in as the entertainment.  He goes looking for a ladder but cannot find one.  He just YOLOs and heads in and tells them he is the entertainment for tonight, but they insist that they have no entertainment set for tonight and that he should go home.  Fur ROLLS A 31 for Persuasion,  the worker decides to let him through.  He asks Fur what he plays, Fur replies that he plays the Zulcoon and his rate is 1g per hour, the worker haggles and they settle on 7 silver an hour.  Gregory tells him to keep it simple and if he does well there’s a bonus gold in it for Fur.  Fur goes in and sees the set up, no guests have arrived, it’s just staff setting up for the night.  Fur will be playing off to the side of the dining room, he prepares for the night.  

The rest of the party still has an hour until the event begins.  Mer is yelling out asking about if anyone knows of a Frida, but nobody pays her any attention other than weird looks.  As the party approaches, we are greeted by Zigar.  He welcomes us for the night and asks if our entire party is here and we tell him yes.  Bro, Mog, Ohm, and Mer enter the mayor’s house, as we enter, a tall humanoid woman. Someone asks for the mayor and the woman turns around and introduces herself as Ava Farson, the mayor of Baneshold.  She asks us to have a seat at the large dining room table, there are 6 table settings.  Ohm pushes two chairs and plates together and is overjoyed that they know he eats for two.  We introduce ourselves to Ava, Mogali, Tran’can, Ohm, and Mermista.  Mog is awkwardly eating grapes off his and his neighbor’s plates.  We tell Ava that we are merely fixing his ship while he takes care of his kingly business.  She is slightly skeptical as she tells us that the merchants have mentioned some of the Queens’ ships in the area.  We say we know nothing of it.  She informs us that it is her duty to be informed for the sake of her city. 

She asks us what happened to our ship and tells us she has the entire night free to hear our tales.  The second course comes out and it is a giant roast, it’s mediocre.  Ohm asks if she knows of the area described in the map that the goblin merchant made for him.  She says she will be truthful once we are.  Bro is able to persuade her that he knows Alf better than anyone and that we are here on business. Alf used to pay her good money to keep his name out of the empire’s ears.  All she cares about is if we will cause her trouble with the empire.  We insist that is the last thing we want and out of good faith we welcome her to scuttle Alf’s ship and that we will take a new ship and be out of her hair.  We thank her for her assistance and that Tran’Can will report back to Alf with how hospitable Baneshold was.  

Furtim is in the back of the room in disguise and uses Detect Magic to discover more about the house.  He notices nothing out of the ordinary other than your usual magic.  FIN   

> ## Session 42

> 5/30/23 Safe For Now (The Gang Wants an Abortion)

We are still at the dinner, as we discussed with Tra’can, we are going to scuttle Alfonso’s ship.  She is just trying to feel out the room as Alf was one of her high end business partners.  As the dinner goes on, we as a party are trying to find out what happened to Ohm’s Fireforge clan as they were pretty much completely wiped out.  Much of Ivalice has ancient dwarven architecture, but as the years went on wars broke out between the different races and dwarves decided that with their superior technology they could wipe out everyone else so they decided not to be a part of it and they moved further north away from everyone.  They built an isolated society and it is weird to hear that one of their clans was attacked.  

Baneshold is a massive trading port and the Queensguard knows that messing with them is bad for business.  The Queen was obsessed with searching for powerful magical devices to ensure that her side won the war.  She sent people up north knowing how much power the dwarves had.  One of her lackeys was Mortimer (RIP) who helped her find the Dodecahedron.  The one person that Ohm is looking for is Ahmad Noke as he is the only one that has information on what happened.  
	
Jamison arrives at the castle, he waits outside and telepathically tells Mogali that he is waiting for us.  Mogali shames him for being so antisocial.  Mermista is still looking for Frida but she already knows she resides in the high court area.  She asks Tra’can if she knows about Frida, TC wants to know why she is looking for her.  Mog tells TC that we are scholars and want to talk to other great minds.  TC tells Mog that she will mark on his map where Frida is staying. (Mer has been stuffing her face with cheese this entire time. I don’t know if she’s happier about lifting the curse or how good this cheese is.)  We thank her for dinner and she tells us she regrets Alf not being there.  She ensures us she will let us know if the Queen comes looking for us.  Mer tries to persuade TC to get a to go plate of cheese to bribe Frida with, SHE FAILS. KITCHEN IS CLOSED.

We head outside and we see Jamison, we decide to head uptown to find Frida.  The uptown area is noticeably different, it is pure white granite architecture.  We approach her building and Mermista knocks on the door.  A male voice answers and asks who is there and asks if she needs help.  Mer is the only one that can hear him but she doesn’t realize it, she explains that she is cursed and is worried she might die.  SHE CRIT FAILS, he tells her it is very late and he bids her adieu.  Mer just starts bawling crying and nobody in the party has no fucking clue what is going on because nobody could here the voice.  Mog tries his luck with this voice, telling him Frida would be really interested in this case and he mentions the Kraken… HE CRITS.  The door just opens on its own and we enter and we see there are books all over the place, on shelves, on the floor, just everywhere.  As we walk in we notice a gray cat and he stops and starts talking to us, “you mentioned the Kraken?”  He introduces himself as Zan, her familiar.  Mog tells him he has a familiar too, he pulls out Air Budgie’s lifeless body.  They tell him about her curse and he tells them to follow him.  Mog tries to figure out if its one of those places that are huge on the inside but looks small on the outside.. He CRITS and instantly figures out it is exactly one of those places.  

We get to a landing and see a very large wooden set of doors and they open up to a room with chalkboards, food, etc. but absolutely no books.  We see a woman in black robes, large windows that look out to the city but you can’t see these windows from the outside.  She has a large hairdo with brown and white kind of like Frankenstein, olive skin.  She looks much younger than she should be, kind of mid 40s.  She is still scribbling on the chalkboard as we approach.  Frida introduces herself and we do the same, she asks about our problem and Mermista explains everything that happened.  Frida snaps and furniture all around the room moves so she can sit and get a closer look at Mer’s arm with a bright light and magnifying class.  Frida asks if she has spoken to the primordial and what their conversations were about.  She tells him about the pact she made to kill Alfonso and give him his power, and that she broke the deal and now Alf is dead.  Bronson is sniffling in the corner and Frida gives him a big hug as she learns that he is Alf’s son.  She snaps and seven books come flying in to the room, F informs her that she is very lucky to still be alive.  

Ohm tries reading one of Frida’s books and he can decipher they talk about the ancient primordial beings. She wants to take the primordial energy out of Mermista’s arm. We ask what she wants to do with the energy. She been studying this for a while, thinks she can contain primordial energy. She thinks she can control it with stones and gems and study it. We say we need to talk amongst ourselves. Ohm sees a blur of the cat run by the corner of his eye.   She sounds super sus.  As we discuss a giant clap is heard and a portal appears and Frida enters the room coming from the kitchen, she brings a small plate of eggs for Furtim and then the portal closes.  Mog tells her that he doesn’t know if we can trust her for wanting to control the ancient primordial power. Even if she means well, it is bold of her to assume she can be the only person in history to control it, it sounds very dangerous.  

Ohm asks her if she would be willing to allow him to cast a truth telling spell on her to see that she means well for our party.  She tells us that she doesn’t like other people using magic in her house but that she means us no harm.  Ohm shakes her hand to try and learn more, but she just keeps smiling with her dumb face.  We tell her that we are going back to the tavern to sleep on it since it is such a big decision.  Zan is now a monkey, Claudio thinks that’s one hot fucking monkey.   Bronson and Mogali go back to the tavern.  Mermista asks to know more of why she wants to harness this power.  She pulls up four chairs with a snap and Ohm insists on standing.  She whips up a plate of lemon bars and puts them at the center of the table.  

Furtim asks how she plans on using it if it can only be used by  a Water Genasi.  She tells him that only a WG could free it from the Conch and now it can be used by anyone.  Mer wants to know if she can harness the power of the Kraken herself, F says it is possible in theory but at a great potential cost.  She still hasn’t told us what she plans on using the power for.  Jamison asks if F has ever experienced being possessed by a primordial before.  F looks a little uncomfortable.  Jam does an insight check, 25!!!, Frida has a brief flash of annoyance, “I’ve done a lot of research, and i’ve done this for a long time” (SHE SIPS HER WHITE CLAW). She simply says that she hasn’t experienced it like Mermista has.  F says she has past experience with the Wind Primordial… Sips White Claw Again.  She says 100 years ago the magic returned in a very powerful way.  She says that several very strong magic entities, (Beings, items, etc.) started to appear.  She says ever since then she has focused intensely on research about primordials.  Mermista asks if she can keep the power once it is out of her body.  RUFIO MAKES IT CLEAR THAT ABORTIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED IN THIS WORLD OR ANY WORLD!!!!!!!!!

Jam asks what went wrong with the wind primordial, she says she wasn’t strong enough back then. F asks Mer how many encounters she’s had with the Krak and what her physical state was in.  She was super sickly and exhausted some of the times she interacted with it.  As Frida learns more, she just simply asked her if she broke a pact with a primordial being.  Mer says technically yes, and Frida just throws the books away and puts her hand over her face.  She then has 18 new books fly down.  She tells everyone that it is getting very late and gives us the Midwestern goodbye as she slaps her knees.  She keeps insisting we try one of her lemon bars, Furtim grabs one and takes a bite.  He CRITS and it just tastes so fucking good as the lemony goodness is exploding in his mouth, he just keeps chewing and can’t stop. The remaining party leaves for the tavern as she bids us a good night. FIN

> 8/1/23 Every Problem, A Gift

We make it back to the tavern, it’s the next morning and we are in our rooms.  We hear a knock on the door and the noise of a note sliding under the door.  Mogali tries to sprint to the door in time to see who left it.  Mog sees somebody in uniform like a courier.  Mogali reads the note and it is from the mayor, Tra Can, telling us that the Empire is in the lower city and she can only keep them busy for half a day.  We are planning on leaving the city to go North to go find out more about what happened to the Fire Forge Clan.  

Jamison, Claudio, and Air Budgie go to see Frida to tell her that we can’t give her the Primordial Power for and that we have to leave but we want to see if we can contact her later.  Meanwhile, the rest of the gang is loading up the cart and prepping for the trip.  Bronson goes and grabs the legendary Choncho and Badonkeydonk to guide us safely on our journey.  Although everyone thinks Claudio and AB hate each other but they secretly love each other and their families hatred for one another won’t allow for this burning love to come to fruition. Frida welcomes them in and is disappointed Mermista isn’t with them.  Jamison wants to know if we can contact her if Mer’s arm gets worst.  Frida hands her a very ornate mirror that is untraceable until somebody uses it in case we need her.  Jam asks if she has any fear about the consequences of trying to contain the primordial power.  She says she has a curiosity and believes she is the one that can do it.  Jam and the crew leave with the mirror and return to the tavern.

Some jaunty fun quest music starts playing from nowhere as we are all together again with our noble steeds for the first time in a long time.  Ohm notices crowds running down to the docks and Claudio goes to scope it out as we head out of town. Jam tries to see what Claudio sees, he sees a bunch of carts blocked and a bunch of guys in armor trying to get to the High Town area.  We start to pick up the pace out of the city, there is one singular huge tower at the exit with an archway underneath it.  We leave pretty quickly and make camp and sleep safely thanks to Mer’s CRIT.  Mogali wakes up the party to unveil Ohm’s new armor, there are dwarves tinkering on the armor, their are wisps of smoke emanating from the armor.  Mog calls the armor the Full Plate of Korok Goran.  Ohm gives Bronson his old Splint armor, it smells of breakfast sausage.

Ohm CRITS and gets us through the magic woods the next day.  We pass through a field and back into some woods and we arrive at a small village.  Furtim uses his Eggle eyes to look into the town, he sees it is a smaller village with a high concentration of elves.  He withholds the info from Ohm and Mogali.  Mog gleefully walks into the village but soon realizes that there are elves everywhere and the joy leaves his swagger.  We immediately look for the tavern, it is called Kari tavern.  It more of a dining establishment instead of a bar.  The tables are grown out of the ground.  (WE ARE OFFICIALLY AT 100 PAGES OF NOTES!!!! TUNAK TUNAK STARTS PLAYING). We asks for rooms and it costs us 3 silver each.  Ohm refuses to give these Leaf Lovers any money and hands his silver to give to Jam to hand the elves.  We go to our rooms and draw some baths and clean up.  Mermista goes to the bath and feels the water and it feels like the coldest water she has ever felt and she notices the cursed mark on her arm grew towards her elbow.

We go to a courtyard like area and it is similar to a botanical garden and there is a large circular building.  We are approached by an elf with fair skin and hair tied in a pony tail.  Mer instantly asks him if he knows anyone that can remove a curse and she shows him her arm.  The elf asks Mog to stop smoking dweth inside the building.  He grabs a few other druid elves and she shows them her arm.  Bro does an arcana check and looks at the Elvish Druids and he sees they are carrying the equivalent of a magical hazmat suit.  Bro informs Mer what is going on she instantly becomes nervous and tells them that it is not contagious.  Mer tries to read the mind of the woman talking to her and fails.  The woman informs her that she is allowed to leave at any time.  Mer asks if they know anything about primordials and they say they don’t have much experience but they have a team of skilled arcana researchers.  Mer agrees to be observed and she enters a room with a bunch of elves looking down at her and Bro notices they are protected by a magical barrier.  

The elves are asking Mer about her curse and she is rambling about how she was trying to save her people and she might’ve made a deal with an ancient primordial being and she MIGHT have betrayed that being.  The elf is scribbling all this down with a concerned look on her face.

Bro speaks to the elf in charge and his name is Counselor Mahar, he is older even for elf standards, he has a light beard and is tall and lean.  He ensures Bro that he means her no harm and we want to study her and help her.  Bro tells him we are going north and asks him about the Fireforge clan and Ahman Noke.  He tells him we are heading towards the great forge and the Fire Elemental but he knows nothing about those names specifically.  The elves attach an orange bangle on her arm and it clamps shut and the murky curse slams into it but it can not progress any further.  Bro notices all the elves have a magic barrier go down to cover their faces.  They give her a honey pop for being such a brave genie.  They give Bro a map showing us how to leave the forest and to reach the giant forge. 

Mermista just happens to remember, after a YEAR of knowing, and informs Ohm that she had a dream about the death of the Fireforge Clan. Two things: the queen standing above the king with a bloody sword and a large circular black slab (where we found the Dodec).

We head back to the tavern and Jamison hears a customer order a drink that is specific to one of his bars and he takes notice. He sees a crumpled note left by the customer and it simply reads. “Lot of empire, getting more strict, I’m fine, be safe.” A drawing of tooth is left as a crude joke.

> ## Session 44

> 9/5/23 Out of the Frying Pan

We’re back in the village of Kari, Mermista is being studied by their medical team for her primordial curse.  There’s a gathering in the main area while we are eating breakfast. Mogali asks one of the leaders if they know about the fire forge clan.  The elder says he knows of them but they haven’t been seen in a long time.  They don’t get many travelers.  BRONSON WANTS TO KNOW THEIR AC.  The elder says there was a string of villages that used to be hear but a lot of them have left since the great wars.  The elder is impressed we made it this far because the forest doesn’t want many people to travel through it.  Mog does a perception check and notices we’ve traveled much farther than we should have.  He asks him if they have anything to drink, maybe La Croix???  They bring out Mermista she’s in a (Wall-E Fat Person Chair). Mermista is coming with us as she is floating in her medical chair.

We leave the village, heading north towards the fire forge.  Ohm is leading us and he notices multiple paths but he is confident we pick the right one. (We almost died of dissentary).   We make it out of the forest and there’s open plains, Ohm sees all and things start to come back to him from when he grew up.  He sees the mountains and he knows exactly where he is, he recognizes a supply town where everyone goes to replenish… it’s called Valker.  Furtim uses his Eggle Eyes… HE CRITS… He notices it is a decently busy medium sized town but no dwarves are there.  He sees a banner with a small white bird with a plant in it’s mouth on a blue and white banner. We decide we should pose as a Druish Group and smear owlbear blood on our door to let people know we’re cool. (Ohm hates his people and wants to vote for Ahmad Noke).

They ignore us, continue into town looking for whores, role investigate 16. Mogali talks with Tara, a bar wench. Mogali mentions that he is just an advenuterer passing through town (Persuasion 13). Mogali keeps smoking while asking about travelers coming through town. Mogali asks about Amon Nok, Tara replies no. Mogali asks for gold from Jamison, Jam hands it to Claudio who throws it at Mogali. Mogali slides the gold coin across the counter asking for any more info about it. Tara explains she knows not much about the name mentioned but brings up a corporal is a consistent visitor of this establishment. 

Furtim plays the zulkoon in the middle of the town (17 performance). A couple of guards come by and nod approval.  Furtim gets 5 copper and 5 silver from tips. 
	
We scout out the area and realize there is a guard that’s a little loosed lipped and drinks a lot and Jam and Ohm are waiting for him to show up. Bronson is still disguised as a sea merchant and separates himself from the group and he goes to gather info at the hotel area of the town.  There’s a gnome at the front desk and Bro asks for a room.  Bro tells him he’s a traveling merchant and doesn’t know much about the town and asks him to tell him about it, the gnome doesn’t care and sends Bro to his room.  Only thing Bro notices is that storm clouds are coming in.  

Jam and Mog are still at the bar and Mog is smoking some fat dweth. Mog says hes looking for beehives as he walks into the forest.  Mog finds a beehive and picks it from the tree and stuffs it in his bag.  It is a waxing moon, not ideal for werewolves.  Mog is begging Jam for 5 gold so he can drug the guards after he buys them drinks.  Mog buys a bottle of alcohol and drinks half of it and fills the other half with roofies. Mog and Jam tell the guards they can’t finish it and offer it to the guards. 
	
Mog is talking to the guards and they ask us where we are from… Mog takes a long pull of his dweth and asks if they like bees… RUFIO ALMOST VOMITS FROM LAUGHTER (SPILLS ANOTHER SELTZER!!!!!… +1 INSPIRATION).  They don’t know the sweet taste of that Dwarve Honey.  Mog tells the front desk gnome that Jam is paying for his room and just leaves.  Jam pays for all of us to get individual rooms.  Mog is lying in his bed and has a dweth dream, he is without his helmet and looking into a mirror, he punches the mirror and it shatters, but it fixes itself.  Mog is in a void of a room with the mirror, and a 9 foot tall figure.  The figure questions why he doesn’t like looking at himself.  He gets VERY defensive.  FRAGILE MASCULINITY IS THE THEME OF THIS EPISODE.  Mog smashes a window in his room and leaves a note saying that Jam will pay for all of this.  Mog enters the front door as if nothing happened.

Mog and Jam wake up and get some hot breakfast and tell the locals they’re going north to find the Dwarves.  The soft hills turn into mountains, the are very HARD mountains, not soft.  They see a check point area and Jam and Mog go through.  Captain Hartlin greets them and they tell him they know Lenny.  He warms them a storm is a coming and tells them they should not proceed for their own sake.  Jam talks his way through and convinces Hartlin that they are adventurers and they can do this. Hartlin remembers when he used to adventure and he took an arrow to the knee and he tells them to watch out for the trolls as he wishes them luck on their journey.

Ohm approaches the check point and tries to convince them that he is ACTUALLY COOL. Mog comes back and tells the guard that he is with him.  Furtim is still in his Townspeople form and tries to pass through the checkpoint, the guards asks him what he wants and he responds he wants to know what is going up there. Another guard comes up and says Furtim is good to pass, Furtim comments how this storm will provide inspiration for his songs.

Bronson goes on his own and screams at all the guards that he is from FEMA (Fantasy Emergency Medical Association) and that if they delay him any more so many good Queens Guard will die.  He intimidates the fuck out of them and tells them to look for high ground and that through Eldritch Gods all things are possible.  FIN

> ## Session 45

> 10/3/23 The Heat

We head up the mountain and encounter a massive snowstorm.  In the ensuing snowstorm we hear a deep gutteral roar.  We see the outline of several large figures in the distance coming towards.  Mermista wakes up in the back of the carriage and vomits on herself, she sees her friends around preparing for a fight and snow is everywhere. Mogali looks ahead and CRITS his perception check, he can tell they are of physical form and that they mean us harm.  Mer instantly attacks one of them and hits T1 for 11 damage with her quarterstaff.  She uses Stunning Strike but the creature dodges it and is not stunned.  They are giant trolls and she dips out back to the group flicking him off.  Jamison goes stealth and sneak attacks by throwing her daggers and CRITS and does 42 FUCKING DAMAGE.  The daggers dig into the ribs of T1 and cuts an artery.  Jam goes back into stealth.  Mog goes toward an even bigger troll, an Ice Troll.  Mog drinks his bigges grungo bag and starts vomiting acid vomit towards IT1 and T3.  They both fail their dex save and take 17 acid damage each.  Lil Budgie bites IT1 for 6 damage.  Furtim casts Dissonant Whispers on IT1 and does 23 psychic damage.  The Ice Troll is terrified and runs as far away from Fur as possible and Mog gets an OA and slices him for 8 damage.  Fur gives Bronson Bardic inspiration.  Bronson places Hex on T1 and uses Eldritch Blast and hurls two streams of pure force into the trolls ribcage ripping off flesh and the necrotic damage melts its spine killing it.  Ohm casts Spiritual Weapon at 4th level and attacks T3 with a massive forge hammer and it smashes down in a blaze of fire for 14 fire damage.   Ohm then shoots it with his crossbow and misses.  T2 runs up to Bro after seeing him kill his brother.  He attempts to smash Bro twice and on his second attempt Bro casts Shield and blocks both attacks.  T3 attacks Ohm 3 times clawing at him desperately but the claws can’t get through Ohm’s dope new armor.  IT1 and T3 both take 13 and 16 acid damage respectfully.  Their fur is melting away and the snow is not stopping the pain.

Mer comes to Bronson’s aid and attacks T2 with her staff right in the troll balls for 18 damage to the troll nuts. She then runs away to the west with her middle finger held high.  Jam throws two more magic daggers at T2 and hits with both of them and hits right in its nipples for 32 piercing damage.  He stealths again.  Ice T comes straight towards Ohm and attacks him 3 times he lands one monstrous blow for 8 damage, HE MAKES OHM BLEED HIS OWN BLOOD.  Mog casts Conjure Barrage and summons a massive swarm of arrows to attack Ice T and T3 for 12 and 6 damage.  Fur casts Eldritch Blast and does 12 total force damage by whipping out his Zulcoon and does a farting cloud of damage.  Bro moves Hex onto T2 and takes out his sword and slices his stomach and melts it and then takes off his head with a total of 33 damage.  Ohm takes out his own hammer and casts Divine Strike and rips off Ice T’s jaw and kills him. Ohm rolls 25 to hit w spiritual hammer and deals 12 damage. T3 takes 10 acid damage and goes straight for Ohm and still can’t get through that sweet ass armor.  

Mer walks her 2 miles of movement speed and gets kinda close to T3 and misses with her crossbow twice.  Jam throws another couple of magic daggers at T3, T3 is building up the last of its strength having seen all of his brethren killed.  But he just sees to glints of steel coming at him slicing both sides of his neck and he just sprays blood Tarentino style all over the snow and all over Ohm’s face and armor. It’s beautiful.  

Ohm does a stone check and looks around the mountain top and stops hates himself for not realizing sooner that this is where he grew up, this is the home of the Fire Forge Clan.  He sees some carved stone that appears to be a giant entrance to a very wide dwarven hall.  30 feet across but 40 feet high.  There are stones inside that glow bright red.  This was a dwarven haven for countless years, the flashing red is part of a warning system.  It usually happens when somebody triggers it or when the core power of the forge runs out.  There is a stone post with an imprint of a hand in it.  Ohm places his hand on it and it recognizes Ohm as a dwarf.  The lights turn a steady yellow and more and more yellow lights illuminate the rest of the hall.  

Ohm yells the old Dwarvish greeting to see if anyone is here. “Fuck Elves” it echoes down the hallway with no response. Bro tries heating up a breakfast sausage and blowing the aroma down the hall 5th Element Style. We go further down the hall and see an open gate, Bronson puts two breakfast sausages that are cooking into a thurible and blesses the place.  We continue down the hall and it looks like nothing has changed since Ohm was there last.  Ohm just follows his gut and goes to his favorite room, the weapons room and sees that most of the items are still here.  He is in a form of childhood wonderment, so happy to be back.  Bronson just utters out “WHAT A SHITHOLE!”.  Mog smokes some dweth to help him feel better from how depressing this place is.  Furtim finds a rotten potato on the ground and puts it in his pocket.  Mermista does an arcana check and notices her cursed arm is trying to influence her and lead her deeper into the dwarven fortress. FIN
	
> ## Session 46

> 1/23/24 Through the Flames

Ohm tries to fight back tears (Magma Milk) as he looks over his home.  He tries to remember where the forge was, he has flashbacks when the great hall was bustling and children were running around and everyone was happy.  Mermista’s arm is tugging towards the door that leads to the forge.  Mermista does a perception check and doesn’t notice anyone else in the structure.  Jamison approaches the giant stone door and presses the square indentation and it slides down into the ground.  He turns Claudio into a bat and sends him to scout ahead he sees a small side hallway with benches with a fountain that is broken.  There is an open door ahead and a closed door to the left. We enter the room and Ohm remembers old timers smoking pipes in this room and hanging out.  Mer’s arm is tugging her but not really in any particular door.  Mer opens the door on the left, it slides down, to the back right of the room is a gilded golden door with a bar across it.  In the center of the room is a decomposed body of a dwarf.  Ohm tries to see if he can tell who this dwarf is, he can’t but he recognizes that the armor is the armor used by the defense units.  Jam sends Claudio down the other door but nothing but collapsed stone is there.  

Jam tries to pick the lock of the golden door with Guidance given to him from Ohm, he recognizes this type of lock and easily picks the lock.  The door starts to make a bunch of mechanical noises and the door comes down.  This is where the treasury was, we find two gold bars worth 3,000 g total, 1 silver bar 1,000 s, and also an iron pole with intricate designs.  Mog does an Arcana check on the pole and feels an aura from it and he realizes that once you place it down it is immovable, it is literally an immovable rod. We collect the bars. JLO IS A SEX ADDICT THAT WATCHES YOU SLEEP. We exit the treasury and go down the hallway, the entire structure is made of solid granite but we notices giant chunks missing from the walls, clearly there was a massive battle in here.  Bronson goes down a random hallway but doesn’t notice anything out of place, there is debris and not much else and he goes back to the group.  We see more scorch marks on the wall and dwarf corpses as we go further into the structure.  We eventually end up a giant door made of smaller doors, a security measure to protect the clan.  Ohm reads the scripture on the wall, it basically reads “know that all is ok”.  Jam tries to pick the complex lock.  Mermista asks Ohm for his blessing, “Benicio?” he gives his blessing “Del Toro”. Ohm does a history check on the door and repeats the catch phrase “All is Safe” the door begins to open in a super cool way. 

In the new room there are more and more dwarf bodies, there is a closed door on the left and an extremely intricate MASSIVE door made of gold and obsidian.  We check the door on the left first. Mer opens the door, we another communal area with main chamber to eat and more of a lounging area AKA the den.  There is a door to the east and a door to the south, we use the pass phrase on the door to the south, we see a dwarf corpse kneeled over on a giant chair.  There is a table with stones raised on it, if you press the stones they vibrate and play what was last recorded on them.  We hear a heavy breathing and blasts, the voice coughs blood and utters “Queensmen” “We’ve locked everything down, they won’t get anything.” We circle back to the closed door to the east, there doesn’t appear to be any scorch marks or dead dwarves in it. We continue down the hall and see another room with some bodies and a blocked door with rubble.  Bronson pushes down the rubble, and he can tell it was a security measure that dropped rubble on the passageway to protect it from intruders.  It just leads back to a hallway that we’ve already been to.  We go back to the massive obsidian door, it has an insert for a dwarven hand, Ohm presses it. The music changes…

All of the locks start to open and the massive door slowly starts to go down, and a strong smell of sulphur fills the room.  We have entered the forge and all of the molten metal has stopped flowing and the ground has cooled, it is now the Temple of Rocks. This is where great ceremonies used to be had, and special weapons were made.  At the end of the giant bridge is the Altar of Rocks where a gigantic anvil is placed.  Now Mermista is feeling the full force of the tugging energy dragging her towards the altar.  Bronson can tell there is a turbulent aura about this place but he doesn’t recognize the source of it.  Mer can sense some primordial energy in this room.  As Ohm walks up to the altar, he feels an energy from himself latching out to the rest of the room.  The fire primordial was Gambrorh, a magma tentacle.  Ohm smashes his hammer on the giant anvil and he can feel an energy and he can see lava start to spurt out.  A deep voice speaks out and says “Son of Grox”.  Ohm says “Who calls?”.  We can see heat waves emanating from Ohm each time he strikes the anvil.  He feels these tendrils connecting with the energy and he gets warmer and warmer (IT FEELS LIKE ONE OF JLO’S SEX DREAMS).  As he continues to strike the anvil, more and more lava and heat start to fill the room.  He is feeling a connection to Grox himself.  Ohm is now in a different place and he fears nothing, he sees a giant dwarf that is like 20 ft tall, his armor is merged with his skin.  He has a massive war hammer, Ohm takes a knee and gives a Del Toro blessing towards Grox.  He has giant red eyes but Ohm feels at home, Ohm feels a warmth and conncetion to him.  Grox says “It has been too long since I have seen my children”.  “Many of your brothers used to live here, now it has been corrupted, how long have I slept. “  Ohm tells him too long he has slept.  Ohm tells Grox of the atrocities commited by the queen.  Ohm asks Grox what has corrupted this place.  As this happens a great movement happens in the lava, it is so hot that it makes Ohm feel cold.  It is the fire primordial, and the tentacle wraps around Grox and pulls him under and now Ohm loses his connection with Grox.

Ohm returns from the realm of Grox and returns to his friends, nobody saw what Ohm saw.  It has gotten a lot hotter in the room and rocks start to shoot out of the lava spouts.  Ohm knows that the security system has been triggered. (Nelly’s It’s Getting Hot In Here Starts Playing)  Ohm and Furtim can hear a rhythmic echoing, it is the sound of clapping.  A voice says “You see, I told you that they would be alive”.  Behind us we realize the person clapping is a 7 foot tall muscular tattooed gay guy, it’s Emmit (SO GAY).  Mermista pulls out a lgbt flag and yells “WE SEE YOU”.  He’s  with Sigurd and he isn’t too found of Bronson melting his gf’s face off.  There are 4 regular guards behind them and another massive guard with a giant shield.  Sigurd looks directly at Jam and tells us to lay down our weapons.  Sigurd says we will be brought to the queen to be punished for our crimes.  Ohm is furious that they are disrespecting his god and this altar room.  Emmit puts his helmet on and says he respects his religion, but that he will eventually kill his god.

Ohm puts on his helmet and casts Searing Smite and smashes the anvil, flames erupt everywhere from the anvil, and he hears a voice, “That’s what I like to see” FIN.

> ## Session 47

> 1/30/24 Heat of the Moment: as Hot as Chad's Laptop

WE ROLL FOR INITIATIVE!!!!  Ohm is smashing the anvil and a force of pure heat erupts each time he strikes it, little pools of lava are around him.  Furtim casts “Enemies Abound” on Emmit, he CRIT FAILS, he now can’t tell friend from foe and starts to go beserk.  Mogali takes a huge chug of his grungo bag and starts projectile vomiting on Sigurd, the Big Guard, and one of the 4 guards.  All 3 of them take 13 acid damage as they all fail.  Sigurd uses his turn to wipe the acid off of his body and he stares directly at Jamison as he’s doing it.  Jam feels his stare and everything around him starts to go black.  Sigurd cast Champions Challenge on Jam and now he cannot move more than 30 ft away from Sigurd.  Mermista acrobatically walks towards Sigurd and attempts to bash him with her staff and misses both times.  (Rufio is a dick and can’t remember Bronson’s name.) Ohm casts “Animate Object” on two of the stone statues of Grox and they come to life.  While Ohm is in this room there are these elemental forces of heat that burst out and shoot down as it turns into lava.  The Big Guard sees Emmit losing it and casts Shelter which raises the AC of anyone within 5 ft of him.  Claudio tries his very best to attack the guards but he is more like a gnat buzzing in their ears.  Jam throws his magic daggers at one of the Guards, it nicks him in the neck for 18 damage. Jam hides into the smoke and vapor of the room. G1 shoots at Furtim with a crossbow and hits for 14 damage, breaking his concentration and releasing Emmit from his trance. G2 shoots at Mermista and was going to hit her but she caught the arrow and threw it back at him, hitting him for 7 damage..  G3 shoots Ohm for 13 damage. (Rufio forgets Bronson’s name AND his turn).  Bronson casts Hex on Rufio and then lands two massive blows to his armor, knocking off his helmet, fucking him up for 34 damage.  

Furtim yells at the BG and tells him he doesn’t belong here, he casts Disonant Whispers on him for 19 damage and he starts running away from Fur.  Mog throws up on Em, BG, G2 they take 15 damage.  Sig lowers his head and casts Turn the Tides to heal himself, then attacks Mog but Lil Budgie saves him.  Mer’s staff bounces off of Sig’s armor three more times.  Ohm commands the two statues to protect the temple of Grox and attack the baddies. Meanwhile Ohm attacks Sig with his hammer and it deflects, Ohm then shoves Sig prone.  Statue 1 tried to smash down on SIg but he rolls out of the way. Bronson then stabs at Sig twice for another 26 damage and shoves him into the ground unnecessarily just to let him know he’s a bitch. Claudio slaps at another guard to his annoyance.  BG Dashes 60 ft, as he takes 15 acid damage, somebody this large should not be moving this fast.  He casts Shelter again.  Emmit just starts flexing, his tattoos start lighting up from the glitter, as he casts rage on himself. He attacks Mog and hits him with his axe for 10 damage, smashes him again for another 15 damage.  Sig is breathing very heavily and sticks his hands into his wounds and casts Lay Hands On Pool and heals himself as light shoots out of him.  Jam attacks Sig with his daggers but he covers himself and blocks the blows.  G2 takes 14 acid damage. G3 goes up to Sig and uses his action to help him up.  G4 and G2 attack Mog multiple times, one shield bash gets through and launches him 5 ft and he takes 15 damage.

Furtim casts Polymorph on Emmit and he magically turns into a Sheep and is Baaaahing furiously.  He then gives Ohm bardic inspiration.  Mogali casts Enlarge on Bronson as he doubles in size quadruples in weight.  Sig wants to kill Jam but Ohm is in the way, Sig’s sword starts to glow and he swings it at Ohm, the first one misses, but the second one hits and Ohm is stabbed with Radiant damage and he takes 19 damage.  Mermista is just not having a good time, BUT she finally hits one of the guards for 7 damage.  She uses a Ki point and attacks again for 8 damage, with her open palm and launches him into the bridge railing.  Ohm casts Word of Grox on everyone within 5 ft of him.  2 failed, 3 passed, the 2 take 6 damage. Both statues swing and miss.  Bronson in his new massive body jumps over mogali and Sheep Emmit and G3. G3 attacks and hits Bro once for 18 damage. Sheep Emmit nips at bro but does nothing.   Giant Bronson just FUCKING YEETS SHEEP EMMIT into the lava as we hear a baaaahh.  He turns back into Emmit and takes 116 lava damage and somehow is still alive but he is so fucked.  Giant Bronson offers the rest of the guards a chance to live but they do not waiver.  Emmit’s melted body tries to drag himself out of the lava, pure rage is the only keeping him alive.  BG tries to shield charge Ohm but doesn’t land a good blow on him.  Jam throws two more magic daggers.  3 guards all attack Bronson and 4 hits land slicing him up for a whopping 40 damage.  

Ohm sees Grox again and he see’s all of these red strands of power shooting out of him, but some of the strands are going dark.  Ohm can sense another presence in the room.  4 large black tentacles come out of the lava and it just utters “POWER”!

> ## Session 48

> 2/6/24 Scorchmarks

Everyone on the bridge rolls a dex save, everyone passes.  These black tentacles start slamming the bridge but everyone is safe for the moment.  Mogali attacks Sigurd with his Halberd and he barely dodges it.  He swings again and gashes him with 14 damage and he casts Branding Smite for an extra 7 damage, he is glowing with Astral Energy.  Furtim casts Polymorph on the Bastion, he fails and turns into a sheep, a very yolked sheep. Then Fur tells Sig he looks ridiculous, it does nothing.  Sigurd has an energy building around him, his eyes turn into pure light, He screams “IN THE NAME OF THE QUEEN!” He casts Spirit Guardians.  Anyone that didn’t past their Wis save takes 8 damage, those that didn’t pass take 17 damage.  Mermista casts Magic Missile against Sig, she sends 8 missiles at Sig for a total of 27 missile damage, she yells “FINGER THAT” as he is getting bla sted.  Bronson Misty Step’s behind Baahstion and picks him up and yeets him into the lava.  As Bronson discus throws him into the lava the Bastion hits the waterfall and falls into the pool of lava and turns back into his normal form as the lava solidifies around him and kills him.  Bronson then walks away as far as possible from the battle.  Ohm swings his hammer on Sigurd with such anger but it misses, however he uses his Bardic Inspiration from Fur and HITS!  He first and foremost thanks his bard for inspiring him and allowing him to make this hit.  Ohm swings a massive uppercut with the hammer and flames shoot out of the hammer as soon as it makes contact with Sig’s chin and his neck is snapped and his lifeless body falls to the ground.  The grox statue hits one of the guards for 5 damage. Jamison sneak attacks G4 for 23 damage throwing his magic blades at him. G3 runs past everyone and attacks Ohm 3 times but 2 land slicing through the flesh of Ohm’s legs for 16 damage.  G2 runs and does a shield attack against Ohm, Ohm is about to be slaughtered but Lil Budgie jumps in the way and saves him.  G1 attacks Mog for 18 damage and then attacks Mermista for 22 damage, she aight.  
	
There is another round of attacks by the tentacles and everyone not on the bridge must do  a Dex Save.   Bronson takes 4 damage and is now prone.  One of the tentacles wraps around Emmit’s melted body and grabs him.  Furtim walks farther away from the battle.  Mog attacks G4 with his halberd for 13 damage, he then uses Arcane Jolt on himself to regain 9 health. He thens casts Sanctuary on himself.  Mermista attacks one of the guards with her staff and crunches one of the side of the knees for 12 damage. She follows up with Stunning Strike and stuns the guard.  Bronson casts fire bolt at the stunned guard and he burns to death all without any help from Mermista.  Ohm Attacks one of the guards and shatters his shoulder for 15 damage.  Jam jumps out of the darkness flinging his blades of death at the two remaining guards, both of them hit the jugular and drop both of them instantly.  

Ohm sees some of the black threads connecting him to Grox turn back red as we start to defeat the Blasphemists that have desecrated this holy temple.  Grox tells Ohm that there is a great disturbance, somebody tried to harness the power of the primordials and failed.  Grox pulls out a burning ember out of his chest and hands it to Ohm.  He is enveloped in white hot flames but it does not harm Ohm.  This is called an Ember of Grox and can be used to cover his enemies in flames.  Ohm gets to add a D4 twice per long rest to start a fire to the enemies around him.  Grox tells Ohm to control the primordial or leave this place.  Ohm calls out the primordial, a giant portal opens up below us and a massive bundle of tentacles appears underneath us.  The tentacles start to open up to show the center of this primordial and a humanoid figure appears in the shadows. Ohm starts to come back to reality and sees the building starting to fall apart.  Ohm commands the two animated statues to find a new forge to carry their sacred anvil to.  We all dip out of the building, but Bro checks the corpses of the guards and finds 30 silver, 20 gold and finds a plus one sword called Sword of the Empire, and when it hits, it’s plus 1 D4 radiant damage.  Rocks are collapsing all around us and we dip out, Chonco and Ba Donkadonk are waiting for us loyally as they are our greatest allies.  Mermista feels something new in her arm, but she rolled so terribly she doesn’t know what the feeling is.  Furtim sets Leomund’s Tiny Hut, we all rest without fear of being attacked and we take a long rest and WE ALL LEVEL UP AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A CENTURY!!!!

Mogali dreams and he meets up with the mysterious figure again, the figure is squatting, his knees are scabbed, his head has green patches, he has long ass finger nails.  There’s a blinding white light and he’s back in the meadow, there’s a figure he recognizes with really long bright hair, she asks him what he’s been up to, he simply replies he’s checking out his other options with gods.  She simply reminds him that she has always been here for him.  She might need his help sooner than later.  He wakes up in a cold sweat. FIN

> 3/26/24 On the Road Again

We all come back down the mountain to the town we were in before. Mermista wakes to a tug on her arm towards the west. We collectively decide to head out on this hunch to the west. We use the map we found on the dead bodies to know the areas marked on the map to avoid altercations. Mogali takes the helm to drive the wagon with Furtim in shotgun seat. Mogali stanks. Like, reeks from not changing their clothes for weeks. With a 15 (14+1 shotgun bonus) Mogali gets our donkeys to peel rubber on the tires and get a lot of speed, getting to town by late afternoon. Jamison works to disguise Ohm (18 very tall, looks super human), Jamison (20 looks human), Mermista (18 old lady), and Bronson (23 made him look fat). Furtim changes to look like a traveling merchant. We arrive at a small town in the afternoon with a low wall around the town.

From what we can judge, it seems like this town is a small merchant stop town for people to use as a rest stop. Mermista (17 perc) continues to feel a small westerly pull on her arm. Ohm checks the ember of grox (13 arcana) feeling an all over pressure that doesn’t point him towards anything. Mogali  goes shopping! For normal, ordinary Mogali things. Takes a “small” amount of gold to do so. The rest of the crew starts ordering Irish carbombs at the tavern. Ohm observes the shit out of the bar with a solid 25. No sign of the Queens flag or other propaganda. A very fancy, but not too fancy looking ranger is in the bar. They seem very knowledgeable and a good source of information. We do not talk to them and instead the party continues to drink. Jameson haggels with a veteran bartender over the costs of the drinks. Mermista, disguised as an old lady, tells the barkeep we are her family and we are traveling to the beach so she can see it one last time before she dies. Also she’s poor. The barkeep lets us know there are Elves to the West. Ew. They aren’t really welcoming, but they aren’t not welcoming either. We are really trying to get a free drink out of this.

Mogali is spending *money*. I’m looking for a big hat. Like, right on the border of comically too large, but not quite. I need more ponchos and robes. Lots more trinkets and bobs. I said “Spirits Be Praised” upon seeing the hat of my dreams and hear a light giggle. The kobold knows where I can get some dweth. Bill Bob Burrow rips me off but I dont have time to deal with him. He has a cousin in Everthorn city, named Zim, gives me a coin with a thumbs up and says Zim will help me out. 

Back in the bar. Party reunited. Mogali changes into their new digs. Looks fresh as hell. The lady in the bar compliments my hat. She’s a real one. Her name is Cyndel. I introduce our merry band as the Problem Solvers, Inc. aka. The ProblemS. We always solve more problems then we leave. THE Gregory Trueshot is her grandfather! Shes trying to spread the Trueshot name. There is a drug trade in this town she calls home, the town of Evergreen.

The business man, is checking out our wagon, looks at us and forces us to interact with him. His name is Walter Cantenbury, aka the Whip, he cracks his whip a few times just like his namesake. He “looks out” for the town and gets people to agree with him apparently. Not getting a good vibe from him for real. He keeps gangs from forming and is clearly not sexist as men and women can be criminals. Ohm rolls 11 on insight and believes that the Whip is being honest about keeping the town on the up and up. My word! The local wells have been drying up. They are on their 3rd well in 4 years, no good. A right shame. He keeps saying he whips people into shape. They have “deep roots” in Everthorn city and apparently that is a joke we will understand later. 

This town is full of characters!

The kobold I met earlier wont take me to the drug dealer straight up, so instead he’ll act as a middle man. I ask Jameson to to tail him so we can get some more details. He reluctantly does so. The kobold goes to a town fountain, then to a market place like area to meet a very fashionably armored greaser apparently. The drug dealer seems even more reluctant than Jameseon, does not want to sell Mogali drugs (boo). He doesn't like that we were talking to Cyndel apparently. 

We went to a local Inn to spend the night and got some free drinks from Walter. We partied with the service staff in the back bar most of the night and Kevin the Kobold hooked us up with rooms.
